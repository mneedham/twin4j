Hi everyone,

In this week's video, Florent Biville builds out an Angular.js frontend for the Spring Data 6 application.

Jesús Barrasa computes similarity metrics of a taxonomy, Daniel Heward-Mills integrates Virtuoso and Neo4j, and Lju Lazarevic shows how to import and model a Retail Food Store dataset.

And finally, Kristof Neys integrates Neo4j and the Deep Graph Library

Cheers,

In Jesús Barrasa's latest QuickGraph he shows how to make sense of the taxonomy around the Perseverance rover that recently landed on Mars.

After using n10s to import the dataset from MediaWiki, Jesús makes sense of the graph using similarity metrics that compute path structure, path depth, and common ancestry.
