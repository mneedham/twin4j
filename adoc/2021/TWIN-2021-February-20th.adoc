Hi everyone,

Our video this week is an interview with NASA's David Meza from Ashleigh Faith’s IsADataThing YouTube channel.

Jesús Barrasa analyses the structured data of the White House website, Clair Sullivan imports data from Python, and I show how to use Speaker Listener Label LPA.

And finally, Jack Collins createsPokémon teams using  Neo4j and the Graph Data Science Library.

Cheers,

Tom is a web developer at https://prepr.io[prepr.io], which is using Neo4j as the backing database for a headless, data-driven CMS system. They just released a forever-free plan so if you want a modern graph-powered CMS, check it out.

Tim is active in the Neo4j community, helping folks with their questions on the Neo4j Slack channel. He is also working on a personal Dutch project called https://112pers.nl/wat-is-112pers[112pers], which provides personalised emergency, weather, and flight information using Neo4j and Elasticsearch.

Thanks a lot for all your help Tom and good luck with your Neo4j based startup and projects.

In QuickGraph #15, Jesús Barrasa analyses the structured data embedded in the pages of the new White House website.

Jesus extracts the structured data in JSON-LD form, imports it into Neo4j using APOC and n10s, before exploring the graph using the Neo4j Browser.

In Clair Sullivan's latest blog post she shows how to get data generated in Python into Neo4j.

Clair imports an arXiv dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and cleans up the data before importing it into Neo4j using the Python driver. She also shows how to query the resulting graph and analyse it from Python.

=== Finding synergies with network analysis

Jack Collins uses Neo4j and the Graph Data Science Library to identify the best Pokémon teams. 

After importing data from Smogon.com, a platform for online Pokémon battles, Jack uses the Louvain community detection algorithm to identify sets of Pokémon that are more frequently chosen together. He then visualises the results in the Neo4j Browser.
