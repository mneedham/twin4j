Pavan Kumar Kattamuri has written a blog post showing how to use Neo4j for identity and access management.

Pavan visualises some dummy data which replicates Google Cloud IAM resource hierarchy, roles, permissions and Identities. He then writes queries to find the roles associated with users and service accounts.

Sixing Huang explains how to compile, compare and analyze KEGG functional orthologs (KO numbers) inferred from all described bacterial species genomes using graphs.

After importing the data using Cypher's LOAD CSV command, Sixing explores the data using both Cypher queries and the Neo4j Bloom visualisation tool.

Papa Yaw Ofori-Afriyie gives us an introduction to graph databases with the help of graph containing Uncle Kojo's family tree.

Papa shows how the graph model contrasts with a relational model and also describes use cases where graphs excel.
