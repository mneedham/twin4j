Hi everyone,

This week we had the Neo4j and the Cloud Connections event and https://neo4j.com/video/connections/neo4j-and-the-cloud/[all the videos are now available^] in case you missed it.

In this week's video, Will Lyon shows how to use Chakra UI in the GRANDstack podcast app.

Jesús Barrasa queries the English WordNet graph, Lju Lazarevic announces the Call for Papers for NODES 2021, and Tomaz Bratanic creates an information extraction pipeline.

And finally, Dr. Alessandro Negro announced the release of version 2.7.0 of Hume, GraphAware’s graph-powered insights engine.

Cheers,

In QuickGraph #17, Jesús Barrasa queries the English WordNet graph that he created in https://jbarrasa.com/2021/01/29/quickgraph16-the-english-wordnet-in-neo4j-part-1/[QuickGraph #16^].

Jesus discovers that there are 28 words to describe "the fleshy part of the human body that you sit on" and 8 different ways of saying “being unsuccessful”, as well as other cool insights.

In Tomaz Bratanic's latest blog post, he builds an information extraction pipeline that creates a knowledge graph from unstructured text.

Tomaz uses a combination of spaCy, Wikifier, and OpenNRE to extract subject-predicate-object triples, which are then imported into Neo4j. He concludes by explaining how this technique can be one of the paths towards the goal of explainable AI.
