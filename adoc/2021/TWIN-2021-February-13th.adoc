Hi everyone,

The big graph news of this week is the release of version 1.5 of the Graph Data Science Library. Alicia Frame and Amy Hodler give us the lowdown, including the first supervised machine learning algorithms in the library.

In our video this week, Florent Biville shows us how to build our first Spring Data Neo4j 6 application.

Jesús Barrasa creates a graph of English WordNet, Jennifer Reif shows how to use Neoj4 with GraalVM, and Michael Hermans demos  Csharp Superstack. 

Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^] and the Developer Relations team

=== Starting an application with Spring Data Neo4j 6 

Our video this week is from Florent Biville's live stream.

youtube::De2ceW9l7kQ[type={type}]

This week Florent shows us how to build a Spring Data Neo4j 6 application on top of a graph of his Neo4j driver ecosystem metadata. Spring Data Neo4j 6 is the latest release of the popular Spring integration and was released in November 2020.

Jesús Barrasa has been writing so many QuickGraph posts recently that it's hard to keep up. This week we'll focus on #16, in which he creates a graph of WordNet, a large lexical database of English words.

After importing the data using https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/4.1/[n10s^], Jesus shows how to perform refactorings to make the resulting graph more suitable for the property graph model.

Alicia Frame and Amy Hodler announced the release of version 1.5 of the Graph Data Science Library. 

This version introduces new algorithms for node classification and link prediction, which are the first supervised machine learning algorithms added to the library. The HITS centrality and Speaker Listener Label Propagation overlapping community detection algorithms were also added.

* In Andreas Kollegger's https://medium.com/neo4j/observable-graphs-ff959f10c4a2[latest blog post^], he shows how to share graphs created with Gram on ObservableHQ. He also introduces d3-gram, which render graphs to SVG anywhere.

* Martin Preusse and Nigel Small have started moving https://github.com/kaiserpreusse/graphio[graphio^] functions into the https://py2neo.org/2021.0/bulk/index.html[new py2neo bulk data API^].

* I https://markhneedham.com/blog/2021/02/03/neo4j-gdsl-hits-algorithm/[wrote a blog post about the HITS centrality algorithm^] that was introduced in version 1.5.0 of the Graph Data Science Library.

* In NODES 2020 Extended, Michael Hermans shows us https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=90&v=1B1n38WmBm8&feature=youtu.be[Csharp Superstack^], a tool he built to create highly scalable Neo4j web apps without Javascript.

Jennifer Reif has started working on a new https://neo4j.com/labs/[Neo4j Labs^] project, where she is integrating Neo4j with GraalVM. GraalVM is a Java JVM and SDK that supports running additional programming languages. 

In the blog post, Jennifer takes us through the integration strategies and then shows how to query Neo4j from Python, R, Ruby, and JavaScript using the Neo4j Java Driver.
