=== Making sense of news — the knowledge graph way

In Tomaz Bratanic's latest blog post, he shows how to create a news monitoring data pipeline using Natural Language Processing and a Knowledge Graph.

After scraping articles from the CNET news portal and importing them into Neo4j, Tomaz does some exploratory analysis using the Python driver and https://seaborn.pydata.org/[Seaborn visualisation library^]. 

He then shows how to pull out the key concepts from each of the articles using named entity linking via the http://wikifier.org/[Wikifier semantic annotation service^].

And finally, he does some network analysis using the Graph Data Science Library and Neo4j Bloom to make sense of the resulting Knowledge Graph.

Niels de Jong recently published NeoDash, a tool that allows you to build a Neo4j backed dashboard in minutes.

NeoDash supports charts, tables, and graph visualisations, which will all be positioned in a responsive grid layout. You can also export those dashboards if you want to share or store them externally.

Clair Sullivan recently joined the Neo4j DevRel team as our Data Science Advocate. You can follow her on twitter https://twitter.com/CJLovesData1[@CJLovesData1^]. 

In Clair's first blog post since starting in this role, she shows how to import a Game of Thrones dataset using both Cypher's LOAD CSV command and the Neo4j Import Tool. 

Along the way, Clair provides helpful commentary on the things to keep in mind when using each of these tools.
