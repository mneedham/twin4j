Hi graphistas,

We've only had two weeks of 2021 but it feels a lot longer than that to me! I hope you're all doing ok whenever you are. 

Our video this week is from Will Lyon’s Building A GRANDstack Podcast App live stream. 

Antonin Smid continues his exploration of the MET Art Collections, Tomaz Bratanic shows how to use GraphSAGE, and we have a new release of the Neo4j Desktop.

And finally, Alistair Jones and İrfan Nuri Karaca launched Arrows.app, a brand new version of the popular graph drawing tool. 


Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^] and the Developer Relations team

This week's featured community member is Brandon Campbell.

Brandon is a Principal Software Engineer at Northrop Grumman. He describes himself as an engineer & graph architect by day and a hopeless romantic by night, which is a complicated way of saying that he likes to make up stories and colour things.

Brandon has been part of the Neo4j community for a couple of years and presented https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/murder-mystery-app-fullstack[Ten to Dine: Building Possibility Spaces with Neo4j and ReactJS^] at the NODES 2019 virtual conference. In this talk he demonstrated how a database becomes a universe using a combination of Neo4j, ReactJS, and the sultry-but-familiar backdrop of a noir murder mystery.

In 2020 Brandon presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUmWND8U3wE&feature=emb_title[Slaying Monsters in the Department of Defense with Graph Analysis^] at the Neo4j Connections: Graphs in Government event. His talk was so popular that it also featured in the Best of 2020 Sessions as well. 

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for your work Brandon

Alistair Jones arrows graph drawing tool is the starting point on many people's graph journey, and now there's a brand new version - https://arrows.app/[arrows.app!^].

arrows.app improves on the graph drawing features from the original arrows, making it easy to drag nodes around and line them up and apply different styling to your graph. You can also save your graphs to Google Drive and export them in PNG, SVG, JSON, of Cypher format.

Antonin Smid continued the blog post series showing how to analyse The MET Art Collection, using GraphAware Hume.

In part 2, we use Hume Visualisations to explore tag’s context, create Hume Actions to analyse the donors, and use the Graph Data Science Library to suggest similar paintings.
