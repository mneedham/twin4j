Hi everyone,

In this week's video, Rik Van Bruggen and Marius Hartmann explain how to do fraud detection with graphs. 

Zuye Zheng analyses r/WallStreetBets, Hadi Fadlallah migrates data from SQL Server to Neo4j, and Greg King explains some of the features of the Monaco editor introduced in Neo4j Browser.

And finally, Shyam Pratap Singh shows how to apply Hidden Markov Models to Part of Speech tagging on graphs.

Cheers,

I first learnt about r/WallStreetBets while following the GameStop story at the end of January, so this blog post is fascinating to me.  Zuye Zheng has applied graph analysis to the r/WallStreetBets and r/Investing communities. 

Using the Louvain and PageRank graph algorithms, Zuye analyses which stocks are being promoted together, in which posts and by whom, and how they differ between these 2 communities.

And all the code used in the post is https://github.com/zuyezheng/RedditSentiment[available on GitHub^].

Shyam Pratap Singh has written a blog post showing how to apply Hidden Markov Models to Part of Speech tagging on graphs.

After explaining the background of Hidden Markov Models, Shyam builds a conditional probability graph in Neo4j and shows how to write queries to determine the part of speech for different terms.
