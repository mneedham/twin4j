Hi graphistas,

Welcome to the first version of TWIN4j for 2021. 

Our video this week is an interview with Emil Eifrem about the FinCEN Files investigation. 

Antonin Smid explores The MET Art Collection, Dan Flavin builds a Christmas Tree using Cypher, and Sebastian Daschner implements an undo feature using Neo4j and Quarkus.

And finally, Shyam Pratap Singh  analyses COVID-19 tweets using Neo4j and GraphAware NLP.

Cheers,

I missed Dan Flavin's Christmas themed post last year, but we can allow ourselves a bit of nostalgia. 

Dan writes a Christmas tree generating Cypher query and also shows what would happen if the Grinch stole one of the nodes!
