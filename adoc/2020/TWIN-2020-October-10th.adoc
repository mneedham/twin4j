Hi everyone,

I hope you all had a good week. There's now only one week until https://neo4j.com/nodes-2020/[NODES 2020^], so it's probably time to work out what talks you're going to attend. And this week we have virtual training sessions for the Neo4j Certified Professionals. 

Our video this week is from Will Lyon’s Building A Travel Guide With Gatsby, Neo4j, and GraphQL series.

Rik Van Bruggen explores the FinCEN Files using Apache Zeppelin, Bert Radke explores Twitter data with Vue.js and the GRANDstack, and Chris Skardon released Neo4j.Driver.Extensions. 

Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^], https://twitter.com/askkerush[Karin^], and the Developer Relations team

Bert Radke has written a blog post showing how to build an app to explore his twitter data, using Vue.js, Neo4j, and GraphQL. 

Bert generates the GraphQL schema from existing data, tweaks it to deal with an issue with Tweet ids, and adds an extra attribute using a Cypher directive. He then adds authentication to the GraphQL API using AWS Cognito, before a Vue front end.

This week Chris Skardon released https://github.com/DotNet4Neo4j/Neo4j.Driver.Extensions[Neo4j.Driver.Extensions^], a library that makes the Neo4j .NET Driver easier to use. It does this by removing the boilerplate that you normally need to write.

In the blog post, Chris takes us through the various functions that the library provides to do this.
