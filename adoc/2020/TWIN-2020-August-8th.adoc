Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Michael Hunger explores Spring Data Neo4j (SDN) 6.

Lju Lazarevic launched the Summer of Nodes 2020, Michael Graham created a GraphQL API on top of Covid Graph, and a project that integrates two of the most prominent open source drug databases was published.


Cheers,

Heinrich is a long time Neo4j community contributor. Originally from Poland, he studied in Germany and now lives in Nevada.

He has invested a lot of time and effort into the Neo4j Ruby driver. After Brian Underwood handed over the maintenance of the https://neo4jrb.io[neo4j.rb gems] to him, Heinrich has continuously improved them. Heinrich added support for bolt both via jRuby (java-driver) and the sealion c-connector.

He is active in our driver community group and always reminds us of the importance of providing good documentation and base libraries for the underlying bolt protocols.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Heinrich!

Lju Lazarevic launched the Summer of Nodes 2020, a series of graph challenges that will run for the month of August.

Challenge #1 is The Barbecue, where participants need to create a graph model covering the various aspects of barbecues around the world. There's also a socially distanced variant of the challenge for experienced graph modellers.

Michael Graham has created a GraphQL API on top of https://covidgraph.org/[Covid Graph^], a set of tools that helps researchers quickly and efficiently find their way through COVID-19 datasets.

You can try out the API or check out the code on the https://github.com/Covid19-GraphQL/covid-graph-graphql[covid-graph-graphql^] GitHub repository.

Vidhya Murali, Cassandra Königs, Sarvani Deekshitula, Saranya Nukala, Maddala Divya, and Santhi  Prashanth Athri published CompoundDB4j, a study in which they used Neo4j to integrate two of the most prominent open source drug databases, DrugBank and ChEMBL.

The resulting graph has led to identification of relationships between drugs and other related features that are otherwise spread across two different resources. 

The code for the database is available in the https://github.com/ambf0632/CompoundDB4j[CompoundDB4j GitHub repository^].
