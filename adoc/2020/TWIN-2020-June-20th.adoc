Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Will Lyon starts a series showing how to build a GRANDstack Real Estate Search App.

Tomaz Bratanic explores the Node2vec embedding algorithm, Dan Flavin solves a triangle counting brain teaser, and Stefan Dreverman starts a blog series on building a low-code platform.

And finally, Mike Lam builds a collaborative filtering based recommendation engine based on beer data extracted from brewDB’s Open API.

Cheers,

Stefan has been a member of the Neo4j community for a long time. In the past he already published articles and series, including https://medium.com/neo4j/building-a-questionnaire-in-neo4j-part-1-3-one-simple-question-c89a18956756["Building a Questionnaire with Neo4j"^]  and https://medium.com/@stefan.dreverman/analyzing-coinmarketcap-data-with-neo4j-4930ba0068e1[Analysing CoinMarketCap data^].

This month he's started writing a new blog series on building a low-code platform with Neo4j. You can read more about that below. I'm looking forward to learning more about that topic.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thank you for all your work Stefan!

In Tomaz Bratanic's latest blog post he explores the Node2vec graph embedding algorithm, with the help of Kaggle's Spoonacular Food Dataset.

Tomaz combines the Graph Data Science random walk algorithm with the gensim Word2vec algorithm to generate embeddings for each food item. He then creates a food similarity graph using Cosine Similarity, before finding communities of food items using the Label Propagation algorithm.

Mike Lam has built a collaborative filtering based recommendation engine based on beer data extracted from brewDB's Open API.

Mike explains how to compute user similarity using Euclidean Distance based on beer ratings, before generating recommendations based on the preferences of users most similar to us.

In case someone wants to migrate their MySQL data containing AES encrypted values to Neo4j, here's a custom function to do this: https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-aes-encryption
Been reusing my old blog articles a lot these days https://info.michael-simons.eu/2011/07/18/mysql-compatible-aes-encryption-decryption-in-java/ 
The user defined function is dependency free.
