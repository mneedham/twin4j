Hi graph gang,

In this week’s video from the https://neo4j.com/online-summit/[NODES 2019 conference^], Brandon Campbell and Kelson Smith use Neo4j to solve a ‘who done it?’ problem.

Jennifer Reif gives us a walk through on multiple databases, Hongping Liang graphs the Personal Genomre Project, and Adam Cowley explains how and when to use sharding.

And finally, I created a QuickGraph of the Australian Open tennis tournament.

Enjoy!

https://twitter.com/JMHReif[Jennifer Reif^] has written a developer guide explaining how to use multiple databases, a new feature in the latest version of Neo4j. 

Jennifer explains the use case for this feature and, with the help of worked examples, takes us through the syntax of common operations.

Adam Cowley covers similar ground in https://adamcowley.co.uk/neo4j/multi-tenancy-neo4j-4.0/[his blog post^], but also shows how to query a specific database using the Javascript driver.

* Hongping Liang shows us how to https://medium.com/@hongpingliang/visualize-clinical-data-in-graph-database-in-20-minutes-f4de223449a2[visualise data from the Personal Genome Project^], using the Neo4j Browser, in less than 20 minutes.

* Paul Drangeid has created a https://blog.graphcommit.com/2019/12/graph-commit-project.html[Powershell "interpreter" for Cypher^]. 

* Paul has also written a couple of blog posts showing how to build knowledge graphs of https://blog.graphcommit.com/2019/11/create-veeam-backup-knowledge-graph-via.html[VM backups^]  and https://blog.graphcommit.com/2019/11/import-vcenter-infrastructure-into.html[vCenter infrastructure^].

* Bert Radke shows https://faboo.org/2020/01/implementing-a-searchbox-with-neo4j/[how to build a Google style search box^] using Neo4j's full text search functionality.

* Bhuvanesh has written a couple of posts about Neo4j Causal clusters. In the first he explains how to https://thedataguy.in/setup-neo4j-causal-cluster-on-gcp-and-aws/[setup a Neo4j cluster on AWS and GCP^], and in the second we do https://thedataguy.in/setup-multi-data-center-neo4j-cluster-in-aws-and-gcp/[a multi datacenter deployment^].

=== When and how to implement Sharding in Neo4j

++++

Adam Cowley has written a comprehensive walkthrough of https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/fabric/introduction/[Neo4j Fabric^]. Fabric is a recently released feature that gives users a way to store and retrieve data in multiple databases using a single Cypher query.

With the help of a flight dataset, Adam shows us how to:

* configure the Fabric server 
* decide where we should partition our data
* query a single shard or multiple shards

In my latest QuickGraph, we explore data from the Australian Open tennis tournament that's currently in progress in Melbourne.

We explore previous winners, their route to the final, losing finalists who subsequently won the tournament, and more.
