Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, we have an interview with David Fox, Senior Software Engineer at Adobe.

Rik Van Bruggen runs graph algorithms over the COVID-19 Contact Tracing Graph, Nathan Smith explores power laws, and Michael Simons demonstrates how to build a Neo4j backed Springboot application.

And finally, Vlad Batushkov builds a GRANDstack flight search application on top of his flight graph.

Cheers,

Rik continues his series of blog posts showing how to build a COVID-19 Contact Tracing Graph using Neo4j.

In part 3 Rik shows how to use the https://medium.com/neo4j/the-graph-algorithms-playground-and-graph-data-science-library-69575a0fb329[Graph Algorithms Playground^] to run centrality and community detection algorithms against a graph of people that have 'met' each other.

After a couple of months break, Nathan Smith resumes his series of blog posts about https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/[Networks, Crowds, and Markets]. 

In this blog post we learn about power laws and the rich-get-richer phenomenon. With help from the APOC library, Nathan shows how to write a Cypher query to simulate the evolution of web pages and the links between them.

* Adam Cowley explains https://medium.com/neo4j/how-i-built-the-apoc-user-guide-graph-app-cb9d1dae7b9c[how he built the recently released APOC Docs Graph App^].

* Lucas Jellema shows how to use Neo4j's shortest path function to https://medium.com/oracledevs/finding-the-shortest-path-from-country-a-to-country-b-using-neo4j-and-node-d36f3aa96fe4[explore the languages spoken in different European countries^].

* Gerrit Meier and Michael Simons https://github.com/neo4j/sdn-rx/releases/tag/1.0.1[released version 1.0.1^] of Spring Data Neo4j RX. This version adds features to the Cypher DSL and has a couple of bug fixes.

* In a live streamed presentation, Michael Simons demonstrates https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvbSjOOcKjc[how to build a Neo4j backed Springboot application^]. 

* Will Lyon has added support for querying Neo4j sandbox instances with GraphQL and Sandbox. You can spin up your own sandbox at http://neo4j.com/sandbox[neo4j.com/sandbox^]

=== Flights Search Application with Neo4j — GRANDstack and GraphQL Custom Resolver (Part 3)

Part 3 Vlad Batushkov's series of posts about building a flight search application is all about the https://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^]. The GRANDstack is a set of modern tools for building full stack graph applications.

Vlad gives us a detailed walk through of each of the application's front end components, each time pointing out which feature of the GRANDstack is being used. The post concludes with Vlad building a custom resolver to retrieve the results of a particularly complicated query.
