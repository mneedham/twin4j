This week they released the brand new Spring Data Neo4j RX 1.0 GA, which utilizes the new reactive driver architecture in Neo4j. You can read more about that below.

Before joining Neo4j, Gerrit worked in consulting where he gained a lot of experience with real world Java application development for large customers.

Gerrit helps the Neo4j user community in a myriad of ways: giving https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/spring-data-neo4j-reactive-sdn-rx[talks at conferences like NODES 2019^], writing numerous https://medium.com/@gerrit.meier[articles^], and helping users on the users' slack and the https://community.neo4j.com/c/drivers-stacks/spring-data-neo4j-ogm/30[Neo4j community site^]. 

Thank you so much, Gerrit for all your enthusiasm and support.

In the talk Joe explains how to use the Graph Data Science Library's PageRank, Weakly Connected Components, and Node Similarity algorithms to explore a fraud graph. 

And if you enjoyed this presentation, don't forget to register for the https://neo4j.com/connections/graph-data-science/[Connections: Graph Data Science^] online conference on 28th April, where Joe and friends will be showing how to use graph analytics to make sense of your structured data.

This week Gerrit Meier, our featured community member, announced the launch of Spring Data Neo4j RX 1.0. 

Spring Data Neo4j⚡RX is the successor to Spring Data Neo4j + Neo4j-OGM, and is the go to library for building Spring based graph apps.

In the release post Gerritt explains some of the main features of the new library, including:

* An improved CypherDSL to help build type safe Cypher queries
* Optimistic locking to avoid simultaneous modification of entities
* Support for adding primary and secondary labels to nodes

=== Graphs and Pyramids in Neo4j

In Max De Marzi's latest blog post he explains how graphs can be used in Multi-Level-Marketing programs. 

The post is based on a version of Twitter where users pay in coins to post messages and receive coins if a post is liked or replied to. Users can also post about and sell their products directly on the platform. Other users can then create their own posts promoting that product, and take a % of the product sale price.

Max shows how we would model this scenario using a graph and then work out the amount of commission due to each user for a product sale. A truly innovative use of graphs!
