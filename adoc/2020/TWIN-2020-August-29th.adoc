Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, David Meza shows us how to develop a Knowledge Graph of Competency, Skills, and Knowledge.

Max De Marzi starts a series of blog posts showing how to use faux bitmap indexes to optimise single model queries, Lju launches the final challenge of the Summer of Nodes, and Ng Wai Foong writes a comprehensive introduction to Neo4j for beginners.

And finally, Will Lyon published Fullstack GraphQL Applications with GRANDstack and 3 chapters are available to download for free.

Cheers,

Over the last 12 months, Will Lyon has been writing a book about the GRANDstack.  In https://www.manning.com/books/fullstack-graphql-applications-with-grandstack[Fullstack GraphQL Applications with GRANDstack^] you’ll learn how to build graph-aware end-to-end web applications using GraphQL, React, Apollo, and Neo4j.

Will has selected some of his favourite chapters from the book and you can download a complimentary copy of these chapters today.

=== Developing a Knowledge Graph of your Competency, Skills, and Knowledge at NASA

This week's video is a presentation by David Meza, Senior Data Scientist at NASA,  from the recent https://neo4j.com/connections/knowledge-graphs/[Neo4j Connections: Knowledge Graphs^] event.

youtube::fVMB2KYNoXQ[type={type}]

In the video, David explains how to build a graph that combines domain occupation ontologies with employees' individual skills. He then uses the Graph Data Science Library and Bloom visualisation tool to make sense of the data.

You can find all the talks from the conference in the https://neo4j.com/video/connections/knowledge-graphs/[video archive^].

It’s the final week of Lju Lazarevic’s Summer of Nodes 2020, a series of graph challenges that have been running for the month of August.

The challenge this week is to explore and navigate a graph of New York's Central Park.

=== Faux Bitmap Indexes in Neo4j: Part 1

Max De Marzi has started a series of blog posts showing how to use faux bitmap indexes to optimise single model queries where relationships aren’t considered.

In the first post, Max goes through a series of techniques to improve the performance of looking up the starting nodes in a query, finally settling on a procedure that implements boolean logic filtering. 

The code is available in the https://github.com/maxdemarzi/boolean_filtering[maxdemarzi/boolean_filtering^] GitHub repository.

On “Terrific Tuesday” we want to remain true to form and deliver a fantastic example of a semantic data model. Using flight data we show how fun and beautiful semantic graph models are and how a perfectly created one can quickly deliver answers.
