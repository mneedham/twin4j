Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Adam Cowley starts a video showing how to build web applications with Neo4j and TypeScript.

Stefan Dreverman builds a new module in the  low code platform, Rik Van Bruggen explains what Fraud Detection and Contact Tracing have in common, and Alicia Frame announced the release of version 1.3 of the Graph Data Science Library.

And finally, Preet Kanwar has started a blog post series showing how to build a Neo4j backed application with Spring Boot and Kong.

Cheers,

Paul has been active in the Neo4j community for years and has been consistently contributing.  He's https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/neo4j-certification[a Neo4j Certified Professional^] (of course!) who has shared his graph journey with the Neo4j community through https://neo4j.com/blog/paul-jongsma-founder-webtic[interviews^] and http://blog.bruggen.com/2016/01/podcast-interview-with-paul-jongsma.html[podcasts^]. 

Paul loves solving challenging problems and is always hungry to learn more while helping others. This is why it's no surprise that he is a rock star as part of the https://medium.com/neo4j/so-you-want-to-become-a-neo4j-ninja-c14a9c296713[Neo4j Ninjas Program^],  where graph-enthusiasts are rewarded for helping others through answering questions on the http://community.neo4j.com/[Neo4j Community Site^].

His passion for helping is so apparent, that even during the exclusive Ninja presentations, Paul is chiming in providing links and resources for further learning on the topic presented, acting as a side-kick to the speaker!

Paul, we would like to thank you on behalf of the Neo4j team and all the community members you've helped along the way! Thank you for being such an invaluable part of our community!

Alicia Frame announced the release of version 1.3 of the Graph Data Science Library. 

This release sees the introduction of graph embedding algorithms, RBAC integration, support for weights in the node similarity algorithm, and more. 

If you want to learn more about graph embeddings, we have a https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-embeddings/[developer guide that covers them at a high level^]. And Dave Voutila has https://www.sisu.io/posts/embeddings/[reproduced the node2vec tutorial^] from the original paper.

The https://neo4j.com/download-center/#algorithms[latest version of the library^] is available from the download centre.
