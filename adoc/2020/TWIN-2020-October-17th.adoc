Hi everyone,

The https://neo4j.com/nodes-2020/agenda/[NODES 2020^] conference is almost upon us. It all gets underway from 8am Eastern Time on Tuesday October 20th 2020. Hope to (virtually) see you there!

We've just finished the virtual training sessions for Neo4j Certified Professionals, so thank you to all of you who joined us for that. My 3 year old decided to make a guest appearance at the end of the import training, which made that one a bit more challenging!

Content-wise, our video this week is from Michael Hunger's live stream and is all about the Neo4j Community Graph. 

We launched the Intro to Graph Algorithms for Neo4j 4.0 training course, Adam Cowley released a library for working with Neo4j from React, and Dr Jim Webber appeared on the Graphistania podcast.

Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^], https://twitter.com/askkerush[Karin^], and the Developer Relations team

Anelia is a new member of the Neo4j community but is already a Certified Professional! Anelia has a Master of Science degree in Advanced Computer Science and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Visual Computing. She is currently working on her PhD in Computer Science.

Anelia's research focuses on sensor data and will solve the issue of data sharing between multiple entities based on informed user consent by using knowledge graphs. 

In her talk at NODES 2020 next week, Anelia will take us through the semantics, data sharing, user consent and the implications of its issuing and withdrawal. Anelia will be speaking at 12:25 in the Knowledge Graphs track.

=== Exploring the (Neo4j) Community Graph

Our video this week is from Michael Hunger's live stream, in which he shows how to explore the Neo4j community graph.

The Neo4j community graph contains data about Neo4j related activity on StackOverflow, Twitter, GitHub, and Slack. 

In the video Michael explains the graph model as well as some of the applications built on top of the graph. He concludes by showing how to create a community graph for your own community.

Adam Cowley released https://github.com/adam-cowley/use-neo4j[use-neo4j^], a set of components and hooks for building React applications that communicate to Neo4j.

If you're building a https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-apps/[Graph App^] or want to quickly prototype a web application, this library will save you a lot of boilerplate code.

Michael Hunger also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GumfNoVqWlU[showed how to use the library^] on his most recent live stream.
