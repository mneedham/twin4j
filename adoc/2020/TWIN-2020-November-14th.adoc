Hi everyone,

In this week's video, Adam Cowley shows off the React Hooks For Neo4j library that he created to make it easier for React users to build graph based applications.

Kristof Neys compares NetworkX and Neo4j, Hantsy shows how to build a Spring Boot application, and we launched the Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark.

And finally, David Allen builds an image annotation pipeline using GCP and Neo4j Aura.

Cheers,

=== Featured Community Member: Luanne Misquitta


This week's featured community member is Luanne Misquitta, Vice President Of Engineering at GraphAware. 

featured::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20201113025608/this-week-in-neo4j-14-november-2020-1.jpg[name="Luanne Misquitta"]

Luanne is one of the earliest Neo4j community members and has now been using Neo4j for more than a decade.

Luanne did a lot of the early work on Neo4j OGM and Spring Data Neo4j and has been a consistent writer of blog posts over the years.

She has also presented countless training sessions, meetups, and conferences. Most recently,  Luanne presented two talks at the NODES 2020 conference: 

* Post-Union processing with Cypher, in which Luanne showed off a much requested language feature.
* Malt Aware: Discovering what to drink with Neo4j, in which Luanne explained how to build a whisky recommendation engine.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Luanne!

In this week's stream, Adam demonstrates the https://github.com/adam-cowley/use-neo4j[React hooks^] for Neo4j library, and in particular how to use the useSchema hook. Adam also creates a useDatabases hook that lets you introspect the available databases on a Neo4j server.

=== Fire up your Centrality Metric engines: Neo4j vs NetworkX - a drag race, of sorts…

In Kristof Neys' latest blog post, he stages a drag-race between Python's NetworkX package and Neo4j's Graph Data Science library. 

Kristof runs Betweenness and Harmonic centrality measures on undirected graphs using both approaches, compares the results, and sees which approach is fastest.

Hantsy has started writing a series of blog posts showing how to use Neo4j with Spring Boot. 

In the first post, Hantsy creates the skeleton of a project using  http://start.spring.io[start.spring.io^], before building a REST API that creates and retrieves data from Neo4j using Spring Data Neo4j.

Neo4j Aura, Neo4j's Graph Database as a Service offering, recently launched on the Google Cloud Platform Marketplace, and David Allen has taken it for a test drive.

David shows how to build an image processing pipeline that:

. Processes images from a Google storage bucket
. Generates annotations using the Cloud Vision API
. Writes those annotations into Neo4j via a PubSub topic.
