Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Lju Lazarevic teaches us how to find graph based problems.

Helena Deus explains how to navigate the virus regulation pathway for COVID-19, Anders Brams builds a movie recommendation engine, and Nathan Smith explores small-world phenomena.

And finally, this week we announced several new online training classes.

Cheers,
