Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Will Lyon  introduces GraphQL Architect, a Neo4j Graph App for building and deploying GraphQL APIs.

Stefan Dreverman builds the UI-‘engine’  in the low code platform, Rik Van Bruggen explains what Recommender Systems and Contact Tracing have in common, and Mahjoub Saifeddine builds a basic web crawler using Go and Neo4j.

And finally, Josh Thurston has written a tutorial showing how to use Neo4j with Python’s popular Flask web application framework.

Cheers,

In the third video, Will continues with geospatial data and introduces GraphQL Architect, a Neo4j Graph App for building and deploying GraphQL APIs.

In other GraphQL news: 

* Preet Kanwar started a series of blog posts showing how to build a GraphQL API with Spring Boot, Neo4j, and Kong. In https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-graphql-api-with-spring-boot-neo4j-and-kong-part-1-1j523w3s?ref=hackernoon.com[the first post^], Preet introduces GraphQL and shows how we can combine GraphQL's Schema Definition Language with Spring Boot.

* Davey Brown shared https://github.com/EarthlingDavey/idenavoice[idenavoice^], a solution to online voting based on the GRANDstack. 

* João Esperancinha shows how to http://joaofilipesabinoesperancinha.nl/blog/blog8-x-files-graph-ql[handle data related to a hypothetical list of investigator cases^] using the GRANDstack.

#BuildForCovid19 is a platform that aims to defeat COVID-19 with hackathons.

One of these hackathons, The Effects of the Seasons, has started a proof of concept using the spaCy library to extract sentence structure from COVID-19 documents and analyse the results in Neo4j.
