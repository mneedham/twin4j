Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Amy Hodler interviews Dr. Alessandro Negro about his new book, Graph-Powered Machine Learning.

Michael Hunger explains the power of subqueries in Neo4j 4, Matt Cockayne explains how to pre-populate Neo4j with data using Kubernetes Init Containers, and the Matthias Mann Lab has created a graph of the Proteome Landscape of the Kingdoms of Life.

And finally, Jasper Blues has started a series of blog posts showing how to build a Neo4j-powered mobile game.

Cheers,

If there was a PhD in tech community involvement, Juan would be our professor. Juan has been active in various overlapping tech communities, and is a Google Developer Expert and https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/neo4j-certification[Neo4j Certified Professional]. 

He’s a frequent conference speaker and has been involved in the organization of various events, like GDG Cali and startup Colombia. He even co-founded the first hacker school in Cali https://www.devhack.co[DevHack]!

You may recognize his name, as Juan is part of the https://medium.com/neo4j/so-you-want-to-become-a-neo4j-ninja-c14a9c296713[Neo4j Ninja Program], and helps out the fellow Neo4j community on the https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j community site]. He recently published a Neo4j based https://github.com/jggomez/Python-Reference-Microservice[Python reference microservice].

This weekend, he hosted an Intro to https://www.meetup.com/CaliSharpCO/events/271182342[Neo4j tutorial in Spanish].
It was recorded and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiBv0nXCgfU[available on YouTube] for your viewing pleasure! He also did a https://youtu.be/qh6Ff2dGXZw?t=5054[Discovering the Magic of Graph-Based Databases with Neo4j (in Spanish)] recently you can watch too!

=== The Power of Subqueries in Neo4j 4.x

Sub queries, a long awaited feature, were added to the Cypher query language in Neo4j 4.0 at the beginning of the year.  In June, Neo4j 4.1 added support for correlated sub queries, which means that the sub query can use variables from the outer scope.

Michael Hunger explains how to use this new functionality, as well as explaining the history of solving subquery shaped problems with various other tools over the years.

we show that building contexts onto integrated datasets bring true value to existing information.
