Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, we have a presentation by Jesus Barrasa and Adam Cowley about the launch of a Neo4j 4.0 compatible version of Neosemantics and its accompanying graph app.

Jean-Michel Daignan analyses Beat Saber data, Sebastian Daschner shows how to use Neo4j with Quarkus, and Lennert van Sever shows how to transform a REST service to a graph service.

And finally, we have releases of Neo4j Bloom, the Graph Data Science Library, and Stormspotter.

Cheers,

=== Featured Community Member: Llewellyn Preece



This week's featured community member is Llewellyn Preece, Senior Director of Human Experience at Indigo Slate.

Llewellyn is a special blend of a technically-driven engineer and an empathetic customer experience researcher. While these two specialties are symbiotic, it's not often that you see an individual be so closely engaged in both. 

Llewellyn is part of the https://medium.com/neo4j/so-you-want-to-become-a-neo4j-ninja-c14a9c29671[Neo4j Ninja program], where https://community.neo4j.com[community contributors^] answer questions on the https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j Community Site]), in exchange for advanced training opportunities, exclusive webinars, and sessions with Neo4j staff from product and engineering. 

For the hundreds of people that post questions each month, we have a handful of dedicated community people (Ninjas) and Neo4j staff that do their best to help out. Having someone like Llewelyn involved to help the community when they encounter obstacles or have questions, is truly a privilege.

Last week, https://neo4j.com/blog/contributor/karin-wolok[Karin Wolok, Neo4j's Community Manager], invited the Ninjas to come together to brainstorm all the cool things we can do for our community to be more successful using Neo4j. Llewellyn offered many interesting perspectives that opened up the minds of others on that call. If you see changes in the community programs or activities that you like at https://neo4j.com/nodes-2020[NODES 2020], know that he's one of the triggers of it. :D

Llewellyn, we're truly grateful for you being part of our community and dedicating your time to helping others succeed. Thank you!

Sebastian Daschner shows how to use Neo4j with Quarkus, a Kubernetes Native Java stack.

In the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fz9i_Q9fCw[embedded video^], Sebastian shows how to build a HTTP API backed by Cypher queries, with the help of a coffee beans dataset. The code is available in the https://github.com/sdaschner/quarkus-playground/tree/neo4j[quarkus playground^] GitHub playground.

This week we had releases of two prominent projects in the Neo4j ecosystem, as well as a brand new project.

Ljubica Lazarevic has a write up about the release of https://medium.com/neo4j/bloom-ing-marvellous-a2be0c3702bb[version 1.3 of Neo4j Bloom^]. This is the first freely available version of the popular graph visualization tool. This version of the library supports the multi database feature released in Neo4j 4.0 and there's an overhaul  of the perspectives feature.

The Azure Red Team tool released an alpha version of https://github.com/Azure/Stormspotter[Stormspotter^], a security tool that creates an “attack graph” of the resources in an Azure subscription.

And finally, we released https://neo4j.com/graph-data-science-1-2-1-release-notes/[version 1.2.1 of the Graph Data Science Library^], which provides a library of graph algorithms that quickly compute over very large graphs. This is the first version of the library that supports Neo4j 4.0.

Jean-Michel Daignan has written a blog post showing how to use Neo4j to analyse user generated data from Beat Saber, a virtual reality fitness/rhythm computer game.

Jean-Michel covers the Data Science, including:

* Data import using the Python Driver
* Exploratory data analysis using a Python data visualisation library
* Friend recommendations using the Graph Data Science library's Jaccard similarity function.
