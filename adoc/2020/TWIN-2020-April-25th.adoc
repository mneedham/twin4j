Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Lju shows how to de-duplicate ingredients in the BBC goodfood dataset.

Rik Van Bruggen starts a COVID-19 Contact Tracing Graph blog series, I build a SARS-CoV-2 taxonomy graph, and Martin Preusse tells us all about the Covid Graph Knowledge Graph. 

And finally, Max De Marzi shows us how to use stored procedures in Neo4j 4.0

Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^], https://twitter.com/askkerush[Karin^], and the Developer Relations team

Thomas is a knowledge-graph nerd with a soft spot for giving back. He's pretty fancy, as a quick read of his https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasdeely[LinkedIn^] profile will reveal.

Thomas is the organiser of the https://www.knowledgegraph.tech[Knowledge Graph Conference]. Before the viral pandemic we were planning to partner on the https://www.GraphConnect.com[GraphConnect] GraphHack. The theme was Graphs4Good, which proved to be a good choice after the GraphHack went virtual. 

Thomas brought in https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekkhetan[Vivek Khetan], https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-puri[Colin Puri], and https://www.linkedin.com/in/lamberthogenhout[Lambert Hogenhout] (Accenture and United Nations, respectively) to participate in https://neo4j.com/blog/2020-graphs4good-graphhack-projects[Graphs4Good GraphHack] on the https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/[UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s)], covering topics from poverty to healthcare, education, and beyond.   

Thomas, thank you for embracing collaboration, knowledge, and kindness within your community. We very much value those characteristics and think it's a true reflection of the quality of person you are! 

You are a true inspiration and we look forward to collaborating with you in the future.

=== De-duplicating the BBC goodfood ingredients

This week's video is Lju Lazarevic's https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online Meetup^] talk about the BBC goodfood Graph.

youtube::m7aGQh8smPI[type={type}]

In the talk Lju shows how to de-duplicate ingredients using Cypher queries, https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/current/[APOC^] procedures, and the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[Graph Data Science Library^].

=== COVID-19 Round-up: The Covid Graph, Contact Tracing, Virus Taxonomy

The Neo4j community continues to try and make sense of the COVID-19 pandemic using graphs. Below are some of the things that I came across this week:

* Rik Van Bruggen has started a series of blog posts in which he'll show how to build and explore a COVID-19 Contact Tracing Graph. In https://blog.bruggen.com/2020/04/covid-19-contact-tracing-blogpost-part.html[part 1^] Rik builds a synthetic dataset using Google Sheets and imports it into Neo4j using the LOAD CSV clause.

* I got very curious about the taxonomy of viruses that have caused the COVID-19 disease and https://markhneedham.com/blog/2020/04/21/quick-graph-covid-19-taxonomy/[loaded data from Wikidata into Neo4j to explore further^].

* Martin Preusse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHa015s-59s[gave a short presentation^] about the Covid Graph Knowledge Graph. This project links many different data sources, such as genome information and research papers together to aid rapid research on COVID-19.

Dakota Lewallen shows how to use https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js[neo4j-graphql-js^] to build a Neo4j backed GraphQL API.

=== Updating unmanaged extensions, GORM Release, Open Linked Cultural Data

++++

</div>

* Max De Marzi shows us how to http://maxdemarzi.com/2020/04/06/updating-your-neo4j-3-x-unmanaged-extensions-to-4-x/[update our Neo4j 3.x unmanaged extensions to work with the 4.x version of the database^].

* This week https://github.com/grails/gorm-neo4j/releases/tag/v7.1.0.M1[GORM for Neo4j released version 7.1.0.M1^]. GORM is the data access toolkit used by Grails to connect to different data sources. This latest release adds support for Groovy 3.

* Estelle Scifo has started working on https://github.com/stellasia/pygds[pygds^], a Python wrapper to call procedures from the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[Neo4j Graph Data Science Library^] from Python using the Neo4j driver.

* Georgios Drakopoulos, Yorghos Voutos, Evaggelos Spyrou, and Phivos Mylonas have written a paper showing how Neo4j can be used to create a https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3368640.3368659[Semantically Annotated JSON Metadata Structure For Open Linked Cultural Data^].

=== Stored Procedures in Neo4j Are NOT Evil 

++++

In Max De Marzi's latest blog post he starts by explaining why the dislike of database stored procedures doesn't apply to Neo4j ones.

He then goes on to show how we can start to build  a Neo4j 4.0 based application using stored procedures.
