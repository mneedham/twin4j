Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Greg Woods teaches us all about the new reactive Neo4j drivers.

Alicia Frame officially launches the Graph Data Science Library and Tomaz Bratanic shows us how to use it with the help of two datasets.

Rik continues his journey in the world of supply chain management and Lucas Moda shows how to create a graph of Sao Paulo's subway system.

Cheers,

Steven is a graph nerd and consultant at https://www.mentumsystems.com.au[Mentum Systems Australia], where he has a focus on governance, risk, semantic web and business management information systems. 

He is an active part contributor in the Neo4j community and an advocate for graphs and graph thinking in his local community in Canberra, Australia.
For two years in a row, he was one of the organizers for
https://neo4j.com/blog/heres-how-the-neo4j-community-celebrated-global-graph-celebration-day[Global Graph Celebration Day], helping expand graph thinking around the world.

But don’t take our word for it, he said it himself in his https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6523394188250275840[post about GGCD] when he said, “We celebrated [GGCD] help share the power of the graph and maybe bring one or two more into the wonderful world of knowledge graphs” 

Steven, we admire your passion and are so grateful for your intentful contributions to open the eyes of others to how graphs can change the world! Thank you for being a part of the community. We look forward to doing more powerful things together with you in the years to come!

=== Reactive Database Connections with Neo4j Drivers

This week's video is Greg Woods' presentation about Neo4j Drivers from https://www.bigmarker.com/series/neo4j-tech-talks/series_summit[Neo4j Tech Talks^], hosted on 7th April 2020.

https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik Van Bruggen^] continues his series of blog posts about supply chain management with graphs. 

In part 3 Rik executes analytics queries against the dataset, using both Cypher's in-built variable path query capabilities as well as centrality algorithms in the Graph Algorithms Library.

On Wednesday https://twitter.com/aliciaframe1[Alicia Frame^], Lead Product Manager of Data Science at Neo4j, announced the official launch of the https://neo4j.com/graph-data-science-library/[Graph Data Science (GDS) Library^]. 

The GDS library provides data scientists with a library of parallelized, robust graph algorithms that quickly compute over very large graphs. It replaces the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/[Graph Algorithms Library^] that was launched in 2017.

https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^] has also written a couple of blog posts showing how to use it:

* In  https://towardsdatascience.com/analyzing-multigraphs-in-neo4j-graph-data-science-library-35c9b6d20099[the first post^], he does a deep dive into multi graphs and explains how to use them in GDS.

* And in https://towardsdatascience.com/community-detection-of-the-countries-of-the-world-with-neo4j-graph-data-science-4d3a022f8399[the second^], he combines multi algorithms, including Connected Components, Louvain, and Cosine Similarity, to make sense of the CIA’s World Factbook.

* Michael Simons shared the https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-examples-record-movies[neo4j-examples-record-movies^] repository, which has examples showing how to use Spring Data Neo4j RX with JDK 14. 

* Michael also https://www.twitch.tv/videos/586359800[presented a Twitch live stream^] in which he showed how to use the Java driver using JShell and Spring Boot. The code from that session is in the https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-twitch[neo4j-twitch^] repository.

* https://twitter.com/lyonwj[William Lyon^] has written https://blog.grandstack.io/graphql-resolveinfo-deep-dive-1b3144075866[a deep dive into the GraphQL resolvers^] used in the https://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^].

* Adam Cowley published an update for https://github.com/adam-cowley/vue-neo4j[vue-neo4j^] with some improvements to the <vue-neo4j-connect> component. If you are in Desktop mode it will display a list of Projects and Graphs, otherwise you will get a login form.

* M. David Allen wrote a blog post showing how to https://medium.com/neo4j/using-the-bi-connector-to-query-neo4j-with-sql-372eacb08fbc[query Neo4j with SQL^].

Lucas Moda has written a blog post showing how to create a graph of the subway system in São Paulo. 

Lucas gives a Cypher crash course, before showing how to import data about São Paulo's train stations, and concludes with some shortest path queries executed with the https://py2neo.org/v4/[py2neo^] library.

The code used in the blog post is available in the https://github.com/lukmoda/graph-subway[graph-subway^] GitHub repository.
