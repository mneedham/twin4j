=== Featured Community Member: Nur Aini Rakhmawati

This week's featured community member is Nur Aini Rakhmawati.

featured::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20200821040606/this-week-in-neo4j-22-august-2020.jpg[name="Nur Aini Rakhmawati"]

We’re not sure how Nur originally found us, but we’re glad she did! 
Nur has quite an https://nurainir.github.io[impressive background].  She’s a PhD with educational experience from institutes focused on informatics, electronic engineering, and data analytics! What a spread! 

Just from this alone, you can assume she has a natural yearning for learning. While it’s obvious that Nur has a curiosity and desire to educate herself, she’s also passionate about educating others. In 2019 she hosted a https://twitter.com/nuraini/status/1117721117639102464[Global Graph Celebration Day] at Postgraduate Information Systems Department, Insitut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.  

We assume that she decided to expand her impact globally, as she was just accepted to speak at https://neo4j.com/nodes-2020[Neo4j Online Developer Expo & Summit (NODES 2020)]! Her talk is on “Halal detection Using Graph Algorithms”. We’re still working through the submitted talks, but she’s in the first round of accepted speakers. 

Congratulations, Nur, and thank you so much for taking your time to help others learn and grow!  
We’re excited to see your talk in October!

I have added two examples using @neo4j (one with @apollographql ) with #Nextjs @vercel (waiting for the PR :face_with_cowboy_hat:). I'm looking forward to it being useful to other developers.

On “Terrific Tuesday” we want to remain true to form and deliver a fantastic example of a semantic data model. Using flight data we show how fun and beautiful semantic graph models are and how a perfectly created one can quickly deliver answers.

Playing with the @CollectionTrust  SPECTRUM 5.0 procedures (using @neo4j neo4J and @GraphXr) as they are core to our collections management system. Seeing how the procedures map and how the links focus the procedures towards Object Entry Information is oddly reassuring
