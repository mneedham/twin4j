Hi graph gang,

This week saw the official release of Neo4j 4.0, which you can learn more about in https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-graph-database-4-0-ga-release/[Dr Jim Webbers's release post^], based on his https://youtu.be/AfhJcyys108?t=1550[NODES 2019 keynote^]. Jim and co also will be presenting a webinar on the 4.0 release on 26th February 2020, so don't forget to https://go.neo4j.com/Introducing-Our-Next-Gen-Graph-Database.html[register for that^].

For this week's video we have Lju Lazarevic's presentation about versioning graphs from the NODES 2019 conference.

We have the videos from the FOSDEM Graph Room, lots of articles about Neo4j 4.0's schema-based access control, and a Human Genes Graph.

And finally, I created a learnt how to use a tool called Streamlit to build a single page web application around the UK Charts QuickGraph.

Enjoy!

Kassim (Vignes) is the founder of a graph-y new startup, http://www.tunjangjaya.com/[Tunjang Jaya], based out of Malaysia. He’s a https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/neo4j-certification[Neo4j Certified Developer] and a lover of graphs. 

Kassim is passionate about connecting with other people in the Neo4j ecosystem. Last year, he participated in https://neo4j.com/blog/heres-how-the-neo4j-community-celebrated-global-graph-celebration-day[Global Graph Celebration Day] by hosting a local event. We just announced https://neo4j.com/blog/calling-all-nodes-join-us-for-global-graph-celebration-day-on-april-15-2020/?ref=social-blog[GGCD 2020] and his event in https://globalgraphcelebrationday.com[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia is already listed]! :D 

Not only does Kassim help grow and support the Neo4j community, he’s also open and looking for feedback and collaboration.  One of the projects he’s working on is an https://community.neo4j.com/t/greetings-from-tunjang-jaya-graftek-malaysia-hr-people-analytics-development/14131[HR People Analytics application], and he’s looking for developers who are interested and willing to share ideas on how to make it great! 

Kassim, we’re so grateful to have you in our community! Thank you for being consistent and active in our graphy-ecosystem!

=== NODES 2019: How to keep track of change - versioning approaches in Neo4j

In this week's video from the NODES 2019 conference, Lju Lazarevic gives us a crash course on https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/change-tracking-versioning-approaches-neo4j[approaches to versioning data in a graph^].

youtube::Cm1yd8d7qv0[type={type}]

In the talk Lju explains why we might want to version data, and then explores approaches to track  an object's state, relationship changes and omitted records. There's also an extended Q&A about 30 minutes in where Lju answers some interesting domain specific questions around versioning.

=== Schema-based access control in Neo4j 4.0

</div>
++++

One of the new features in Neo4j 4.0 is schema based security, and we've got several blog posts covering different aspects of this functionality. 

* Luanne Misquitta provides an example of how we could https://graphaware.com/neo4j/2020/02/06/multi-tenancy-neo4j.html[configure access for different users in a multi tenant setup^].

* Bert Radke shows how restricting access to nodes with a certain label https://faboo.org/2020/01/schema-access-control/[changes the results that we get back from the shortest path algorithm^].

* Rik Van Bruggen http://blog.bruggen.com/2020/01/securing-my-beergraph-with-neo4j-40.html[revisits his famous Beer Graph^] and makes it child proofed by restricting access to the alcohol percentage properties and relationships.

* Hongping Liang https://medium.com/@hongpingliang/human-genes-graph-980b379baaaf[visualises over 40,000 human genes in Neo4j^], and then queries them by chromosome or chromosome regions.

* I wrote a blog post showing how to https://markhneedham.com/blog/2020/01/29/neo4j-finding-longest-path/[find the longest path in a graph^], while trying to find out which player lost the most Australian Open Finals in a row.

* Sinisa Drpa explains how to https://tagtaxa.com/getting-an-insight-of-blockchain-transactions-with-neo4j-graph-database/[import data from the Lisk blockchain into Neo4j^], and then explores blockchain transactions flow.

* Akash Surwase shows how to https://www.opcito.com/blogs/backup-and-restore-neo4j-graph-database-using-ansible/[automate Neo4J database backup and restore using Ansible^].

* Gerrit Meier announced the https://medium.com/neo4j/spring-data-neo4j-rx-beta-iii-79573a773584[third beta release of Spring Data Neo4j RX (SDN/RX)^], the shiny new version of SDN for Neo4j 4.0.

=== FOSDEM Graph Systems and Algorithms devroom

</div>

FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate, and the 2020 version was held on the 1st and 2nd February 2020. 

For the 8th year in a row there was a graph databases room, and the videos are now available. There are lots of interesting ones, including:

* https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/graph_neo4j_algos/[The Neo4j Graph Algorithms Library: An Overview^] 
* https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/graph_cypher_sharding/[Cypher enhancements for sharded and federated graph databases^]
* https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/graph_temporal_gradoop/[Temporal Graph Analytics with GRADOOP^]

=== Creating an Interactive UK Official Charts Data App with Streamlit and Neo4j

++++
<div style="float:right; padding: 2px	">

</div>
++++

I recently came across Streamlit, a tool that makes it easy to build data based single page web applications, and wanted to give it a try.

The UK Charts QuickGraph gave me a perfect opportunity, so I created a Streamlit app that let me explore this dataset via various DataFrames and interactive charts.
