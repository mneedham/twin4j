This week's featured community member is Roni Das.

Roni was working as a Cyber Security Consultant at a large consultancy when he first encountered Neo4j in one of the Threat management tools he was working with.

He is very interested in continuous learning and teaching and has been doing so in the open. He taught himself Cypher and Neo4j and shared his progress on the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZqGKg0ad7k&list=PLI8raxzYtfGyQl1wYIasuZ01Znl3isjU0[Total Technology^] YouTube channel. So far he has created 74 Neo4j, Python, and Cypher videos. 

Michael Hunger was pointed to Roni's channel during a https://twitch.tv/neo4j_[Twitch^] session by a viewer who was requesting more Python content around Neo4j. Michael invited Roni to appear on his weekly Twitch stream, and this week Roni presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeC6dITq3VE&list=PL9Hl4pk2FsvXjk0hrerr78pLN-477pDLo&index=2[Getting started with Neo4j and Python(Flask)^].

Roni also offers consulting around Neo4j, Python and more.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Roni!

It's week 2 of Lju Lazarevic's Summer of Nodes 2020, a series of graph challenges that are running for the month of August.

The challenge this week is to import data from The New York's Met museum into Neo4j and then use the Bloom visualisation tool to answer a series of questions about the art displays.

Siddhartha Sehgal has written an extensive tutorial about graph modeling with Neo4j. 

Siddhartha starts by explaining why graph databases are useful, before comparing and contrasting relational databases and graphs. He then shows how to evolve graph models for popular domains by understanding the questions being asked of the data and using query profiling tools to evaluate performance.

Mark Cleverley has been exploring Instagram data and has written a blog post showing how to model this domain using graphs.

Mark shows how to construct an Instagram graph using the py2neo library, and then goes through the types of questions that we can ask once the data is in graph format.
