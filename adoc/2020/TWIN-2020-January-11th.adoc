This Week in Neo4j - Analyzing .NET Dependencies, Coloring a Sudoku Graph, Christmas Messages Graph, Making Graph Algorithms ‘Clique’

[Body copy:]
////

Hi graph gang,

In this week’s video from the https://neo4j.com/online-summit/[NODES 2019 conference^], Joe Depeau explains how graph algorithms through the medium of classic teen films. 

Nathan Smith tries to solve a Sudoku, Jesús Barrasa graphs Christmas messages, and Mike Solomon analyses Twitter data.

And finally, Greg Shackles uses F# and Neo4j to analyse a .NET dependency graph.

Enjoy!
Mark Needham, Karin Wolok, and the Developer Relations team

=== NODES 2019: Making Graph Algorithms 'Clique'

In this week's video from the https://neo4j.com/online-summit/[NODES 2019^], Joe Depeau explains how graph algorithms through the medium of classic teen films.

After giving an overview of the graph algorithm library, Joe moves on to some applied examples. We use PageRank to find the popular students in the 1988 movie Heathers and Label Propagation to find communities of people in Mean Girls.

=== Coloring a Sudoku graph with Neo4j

Nathan Smith tries using the recently released https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/k1coloring/[K-1 Coloring Graph Algorithm^] to colour a Sudoku Graph. 

In the post Nathan shows how to model a Sudoku grid in Neo4j, and then tries to fill in a valid configuration using the algorithm. It gets close, but doesn't quite solve the puzzle perfectly!

=== QuickGraph: Christmas Messages Graph

In https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Jesús Barrasa^]'s latest QuickGraph blog post, he analyses the Christmas messages from some of Europe's heads of state.

Jesús uses the popular NLTK library to process the speeches, and then creates a graph from the extracted words and word stems.

He then queries the graph, finding out which countries are most self referential, and which mention climate the most. Jesús concludes the post by using the Graph Algorithms Library to compute the similarity of the Christmas messages.

Greg Shackles uses a combination of F# and Neo4j to explore the dependencies between libraries in a .NET project.

Greg shows how to export the dependencies to a CSV file using an F# script, load them into Neo4j using LOAD CSV, and explore the dependency graph with various Cypher queries. 

F# was one of my favourite scripting languages when I https://markhneedham.com/blog/tag/f/[used iit at the start of the last decade^], so it was great to see it being used alongside my favourite graph database.
