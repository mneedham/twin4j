Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Adam Cowley and Jesus Barrasa give a hands on introduction to n10s, the low-code UI for loading RDF data into Neo4j.

Jasper Blues continues the series of blog posts showing how to build a Neo4j-powered mobile game, Mathias Tiberghien shows how to create a Neo4j backed application using TypeScript, and Sebastian Daschner shows how to perform schema migrations in Kubernetes.

And finally, Adam Cowley launched the redesign of the Developer guides and a new beefed up Graph Data Science section.

Cheers,

=== Featured Community Member: Maxime Guery

This week's featured community member is Maxime Guery.


featured::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20200731082531/this-week-in-neo4j-1-august-2020-2.jpg[name="Maxime Guery"]

Maxime (a.k.a Cobra) is one of those community members that dived in full-force into the community soon after his discovery of graph databases. His experiences and interests are in AI and data science, so naturally, when he started a new role at Data Nostra working with Neo4j, he was hooked.

Maxime quickly got his https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/neo4j-certification/[Neo4j Certification^] and started actively contributing to the community. He signed up for the https://medium.com/neo4j/so-you-want-to-become-a-neo4j-ninja-c14a9c296713[Neo4j Ninja Program^] to help others while strengthening his own skills.

He’s quickly become one of the most helpful people on the Neo4j community site. We haven’t shared this with him yet, but we even received internal feedback on how “this community member is really going above and beyond answering questions”.

We see a lot of growth potential in Maxime and we’re super excited that he’s joined our community and become so active. His efforts are highly appreciated and we’re anticipating seeing the lives of many graph-enthusiast he’s going to help along his journey.

Cobra, thanks for being such an integral part of the Neo4j community and if there’s anything you need from us along the way, we’re here for you!

Mathias Tiberghien shows how to create a Neo4j backed application using TypeScript, Angular, and a movies dataset.

In the blog post, Mattias takes us step by step through the class structure of the application, how that maps to the graph schema, and how the application evolved over time. The code for the application is https://github.com/mathiastiberghien/graph_based_coding[available on GitHub^].

Data integration in cheminformatics can get hairy, but extremely rewarding. Here,

we show that building contexts onto integrated datasets bring true value to existing information.
