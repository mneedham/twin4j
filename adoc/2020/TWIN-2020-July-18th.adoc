Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Will Lyon shows off a tool that enables a low-code approach to building GraphQL APIs.

Rik Van Bruggen revisits the graph of Belgian executives, Lju Lazarevic announces the Neo4j Summer of Nodes, and Sephi Berry builds a graph network pipeline with Dagster.

And finally, Preet Kanwar has started a blog post series showing how to build a Neo4j backed application with Spring Boot and Kong.

Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^], https://twitter.com/askkerush[Karin^], and the Developer Relations team

=== Low Code GraphQL with Neo4j GraphQL Architect 

This week's video is a presentation by Will Lyon about Neo4j GraphQL Architect, a graph app that enables low-code development of GraphQL APIs.

youtube::Hh_n9Sj692E[type={type}]

In the video Will gives us a walk through of the tool, showing how to infer a schema for an existing database, import new data using mutations, and query it using the in-built GraphiQL IDE.

=== Implementing a graph network pipeline with Dagster

Dagster is a system for building modern data applications and Sephi Berry has written a blog post showing how to use it to build a graph network pipeline.

Using data from StatsBomb, a football analytics company, Sephi shows how to load CSV data, massage it to fit the graph schema, before exporting new CSV files that are imported into Neo4j.

Back in 2017, Rik Van Bruggen wrote a couple of blog posts exploring the network of executives of Belgian public companies, based on an article in the De Tijd newspaper. Fast forward a few years and they sent him the 2020 version of the dataset to verify their analysis. 

In this post, Rik shows how to use the Graph Data Science Library to find the most influential executives and the communities that they form.
