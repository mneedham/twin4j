Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Karin Wolok gives us a 10 minute introduction to graph databases.

Tomaz Bratanic explores Lord of the Ring data, Chris Prenninger launches Neo4j Commander, and Nigel Small announces the new Go Driver.

And finally, Nathan Smith demonstrates how innovations spread across networks.

Cheers,

Sebastian is very passionate about helping other developers to get better and more effective in their daily work. 
He has published a lot of articles, amazing videos, and even a https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/effective-developer-podcast[podcast to that purpose^]. Definitely make sure to check out his https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com[content and channels^] and his frequent https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/developer-productivity-question-answer-session-june[developer productivity sessions^].


In the last few months Sebastian got his hands into Neo4j, https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/neo4j-ogm-with-quarkus[showing how to use Neo4j via Neo4j-OGM in Quarkus^], the modern, native Java Microservice framework from RedHat.
Following that he dove into the Kubernetes/Helm setup and operations for Neo4j demoing it on the IBM IKS service (https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/neo4j-deployment-managed-k8s[setup^], https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/neo4j-single-core-managed-k8s[single instance^], https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/neo4j-backup-instance-k8s[backup^], https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/neo4j-restore-backup-k8s[restore^]). 
He even went so far as contributing fixes to the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-helm[Neo4j Helm chart^]. 

Thanks so much Sebastian for all your contributions.

=== What is a graph database? (in under 10 min)

This week's video is by Karin Wolok, Neo4j's Program Manager for Community Development & Enablement.

In this video Karin explains what a graph database is and why you'd want to use one, before going through some use cases that are particularly suited to graphs.

In Tomaz Bratanic's latest blog post, we explore Lord of the Ring data extracted from Wikidata.

After importing and cleaning up the data, Tomaz shows how to use the Graph Data Science Library to find communities within the family network and bridge nodes between those communities.

Chris Prenninger launched https://netbizltd.com/neo4j/[Neo4j Commander^], a Graph App that makes it easy to update graph data without having to write Cypher queries.

It also keeps an undo history of changes made to help recover from any mistakes, and can be installed directly from the https://install.graphapp.io/[Graph App installer^].

* Nigel Small https://medium.com/neo4j/having-another-go-e50823b6fc79[announced the launch of version 1.8^] of the Neo4j Go Driver. This version removes the dependency of the C connector library, which was causing installation issues for a lot of users. It has been built for the Neo4j 3.5 series, but also has preliminary support for the Neo4j 4.0 series.

* In Robin Moffatt's https://www.confluent.io/blog/stream-analyze-visualize-data-with-kafka-ksqldb-and-friends/[latest blog post^], he shows how to analyse Wi-Fi data from his Raspberry Pi with help from Kafka, Neo4j, Elastic, and friends.

* The cyberSW team https://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/2020/06/09/introducing-cybersw-1-0/[announced the release of version 1.0^] of their Knowledge Discovery System, which can be used to search, explore, and analyse the pre-Hispanic archaeological record of the U.S. Southwest and Northwest Mexico

* Cristina Escalante presented https://www.facebook.com/PalmBeachTech/videos/300379600985550/[Analysing Political Contributions with Neo4j^] at Palm Beach Tech.

Nathan Smith continues his series of blog posts about Networks, Crowd, and Markets. This week we explore Chapter 19, which is about the way that innovations spread across networks.

With the help of a Game of Thrones dataset, Nathan shows how to write Cypher queries to explore how the adoption of a strategy would (or indeed wouldn't) spread across a social network.
