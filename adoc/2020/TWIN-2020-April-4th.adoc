Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, Michal Bachman uses the Hume insights engine for contact tracing and smart quarantine in the context of the current coronavirus pandemic.

TasoX demonstrates a tool for importing Windows Events into Neo4j, Rik continues his journey in the world of supply chain management, and NEuler has been updated to use the Graph Data Science Library.

And finally, Adam Cowley gives us a rundown of the new features in the latest release of the Neo4j Desktop.

Cheers,

=== Contact Tracing Using GraphAware Hume (COVID-19)

This week's video is a timely one about using the Hume insights engine for contact tracing and smart quarantine in the context of the current coronavirus pandemic.

In the video Michal Bachman shows how to use Hume to identify people at risk using contact tracing, suggest who should be informed or quarantined, visually explain why someone is at risk, find quarantine offenders, and much more.

Rik Van Bruggen continues his series of blog posts about supply chain management with graphs. 

In part 2 Rik starts by verifying the data imported in part 1, an important task that helps flush out any mistakes in our import scripts. 

In this case everything is fine, so we can move onto exploring http://cmuscm.blogspot.com/2014/01/multi-echelon-inventory-optimization.html[multi-echelon^] supply networks using Cypher's powerful https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/patterns/#cypher-pattern-varlength[variable length pattern matching^].

TasoX continues a series of blog posts about Windows Events & Sysmon Visualization using Neo4j.

In part 2 TasoX explains how to use a tool called https://github.com/tasox/Epimitheus[Epimitheus^] to import Windows Events into Neo4j, and then shows how to make sense of those events using Cypher queries and graph visualisations.
