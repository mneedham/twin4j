Hi graph gang,

In this week's video, we have a presentation by Max De Marzi where he shares graph data modeling best practices.

Vladimir Plizga builds a Spring Integration Graph, JHipster now has support for Neo4j, and the CFP for NODES 2020 is now open.

And finally, Vlad Batushkov illustrates the circular money flow of a very simplified financial system using Neo4j.

Cheers,

=== Featured Community Member: John Fleming


This week's featured community member is John Fleming, Founder & CEO at Kaavio.

featured::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20200529101746/featured24Feb-1.png[name="John Fleming"]

John Fleming lives in the intersection of finance, technology, and the relationship between humans with technology. He’s also a passionate (surpirse!) graph nerd! 

If his name sounds slightly familiar, it may be because he recently presented at https://neo4j.com/connections[Neo4j Connections] on   https://neo4j.com/connections/financial-services/[Graphs for Impact Analysis in Financial Markets]. Sounds cool, right?!  If you missed it, lucky for you, the presentations are archived and you can access it https://go.neo4j.com/connections-graphs-in-financial-services-lp.html?_ga=2.206232019.1971220681.1590688742-317393079.1584469532[here]. 

We love when users from our community share their stories, and John’s was one of the highly anticipated presentations, so we decided to feature him to show our return love for his contributions to educate the wider graph community. 

Thanks, John! We look forward to seeing what more thought-provoking projects you create in the future!

The Spring Integration Graph is a JSON graph representation of the current state of all enterprise integration pattern components and their relationships.

Vladimir Plizga shows us how to import, query and visualise this graph in Neo4j, with help from APOC and the Neo4j Browser.

In Vlad Batushkov's latest blog post, he illustrates a type of money laundering activity called “Circular money flow” of a very simplified financial system using Neo4j.

After creating a sample graph using the APOC Graph Generator, Vlad derives a transaction subgraph and then shows how to query it to detect potentially fraudulent activity.

Use @ksqlDB to build stateful aggregations that can be queried in place or pushed downstream to other data stores. @rmoff shares how in our latest blog post, leveraging @apachekafka, @MongoDB, @elastic, and @neo4j for building apps and analysis: https://cnfl.io/wi-fi-data-with-kafka-and-friends
