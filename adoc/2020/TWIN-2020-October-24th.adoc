Hi everyone,

We hope you enjoyed the NODES 2020 conference on Tuesday. The DevRel team had fun interacting with you in the various sessions. 

We know that you probably weren't able to attend all the sessions that you attended but, fear not, the sessions were all recorded and are available to watch at https://neo4j.com/video/nodes-2020/[neo4j.com/video/nodes-2020^]. 

There was only one contender for our featured video this week - Emil Eifrem and Alicia Frame's NODES 2020 keynote presentation. Alicia and Amy Hodler also announced the preview release of version 1.4 of the Graph Data Science Library.

David Allen explains everything there is to know about supernodes, there's a new Neo4j Streams release, and Ilyas Malgazhdarov starts a series of posts on the GRANDstack.

Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^], https://twitter.com/askkerush[Karin^], and the Developer Relations team

Ilyas Malgazhdarov has started a series of blog posts showing how to build a Tinder for indie hackers web application using the GRANDstack. The GRANDstack is a combination of technologies that work together to enable developers to build data-intensive full-stack applications. 

In the first post, Ilyas walks through mock-ups of the product, creates the graph model using http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/#[Arrows^], and explains the Cypher query behind one of the screens.
