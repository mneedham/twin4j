Hi graphistas,

This week's video is from a new series about Spring Data Neo4j by Gerrit Meier. 

Adam Cowley announced the launch of Charts, we launched the new Neo4j 4.0 certification, and Hantsy concludes the Spring Data Neo4j series by showing how to write custom queries.

And finally, Jesús Barrasa builds a graph of the UNESCO Thesaurus.


Cheers,

Adam Cowley announced the launch of http://charts.graphapp.io/[Charts^], a Neo4j Graph App that makes it easy to create charts on top of your graph data.

Charts has a visual query builder that generates the queries the charts are based on. Those queries can then be used in dashboards to create tables, bar charts, line charts, and more.

It's been almost a year since the last QuickGraph, but https://twitter.com/BarrasaDV[Jesús Barrasa^] is back with QuickGraph #12, in which he graphs the UNESCO Thesaurus.  

After showing how to import the thesaurus using https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/4.1/[n10s^], Jesús shows how to make sense of the data using pure Cypher queries, as well as the GDS Library.
