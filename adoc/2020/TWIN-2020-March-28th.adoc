Hi graph gang,

I'm back to take over the TWIN4j reins. Thanks to Jennifer, Will, and Lju for curating the weekly graph news in my absence. 

In this week's video, Calin Constantinov shows us how to make graph patterns show themselves in various datasets.

We had the launch of the Neo4j BI Connector, TasoX explores Windows Events, and Rik begins his journey into the world of supply chain management.

And finally, several COVID-19 related projects have been created. Be sure to check those out, and if you have free time, I'm sure they'd appreciate any help you can give.

Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^], https://twitter.com/askkerush[Karin^], and the Developer Relations team

This week's featured community member is Siraj Munir, Lecturer of Computer Science at PAF-Karachi Institute of Economics & Technology, and Data Scientist.

Siraj has been an advocate for graphs for quite a while now and has got involved in our community in almost every opportunity he’s had. He’s organized events in Karachi, Pakistan as part of https://neo4j.com/blog/heres-how-the-neo4j-community-celebrated-global-graph-celebration-day[Global Graph Celebration Day] events (in 2019 for the 1st ever GGCD and again this year), he’s part of our https://neo4j.com/speaker-program[Neo4j Speaker Program].

He also submitted an awesome project for https://medium.com/neo4j/graphhackers-lets-unite-to-help-save-the-world-graphs4good-2020-fed53562b41f[Graphs4Good GraphHack]  - https://community.neo4j.com/t/knowledge-graph-to-the-rescue-covid-19/16201[Knowledge Graph to the Rescue]. We just did our kick-off this past Friday and https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0MnwzCCPGRXRHVrx7EdnSlT34JXrwGzWgfE3aWn4ME/edit?usp=sharing[projects have been posted].

It’s pretty apparent that Siraj feeds off the combination of learning and teaching, helping and sharing.  He even launched https://www.linkedin.com/in/nerd-s-lab-881243199[Nerd’s Lab] late last year, with a goal to “share knowledge and skills” and “link academia knowledge with industry ecosystem”. 

Siraj, we’re so thankful to have you in our community! Thank you for being so passionate about helping others be better. You’re a true contributor and we admire your hard work!

=== NODES 2019: Making patterns show themselves

In this week’s video from the https://neo4j.com/online-summit/[NODES 2019^] online conference, Calin Constantinov shows us https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/making-pattern-show-themselves-investigation-social-network[how to make graph patterns show themselves^].

In the talk Calin takes us through various datasets, including LinkedIn and the Facebook graph, and shows the insights that can be derived from each one.

Rik Van Bruggen has started writing a series of blog posts about supply chain management with graphs. 

In part 1 Rik explains his search for an appropriate dataset and then takes us through the steps to import and clean up the data.

TasoX has started writing a series of blog posts showing how to gain an in-depth understanding of Windows Events using graphs.

In part 1 TasoX explains how to enable Windows Events Forwarding and describes the challenges he overcame while using the Neo4j Python driver to import XML data produced by Windows Event Viewer.

The Neo4j community has been busy making sense of the COVID-19 pandemic data using graphs. Below are some of the projects that I came across this week:

* https://github.com/tracemission[tracemission^] is a project submission from the https://twitter.com/WirvsVirusHack[WirvsVirusHackathon^]. It lets users log their presence during specific time slots at a location. If a virus infected person visited the location at the same time, Tracemission supplies means to contact individuals potentially at risk of an infection.

* The Upcode Academy have created a https://co.vid19.sg/cases[graph-based data visualization^] of cases in Singapore, using Neo4j.

* Alex Law has been https://medium.com/neo4j/covid-19-with-graphxr-and-neo4j-16ea37686ca5[compiling cases caused by cross-country travel^] from the available reports to create a travel log for COVID-19. Alex then uses Neo4j and GraphXR to detect the hubs that have spread the virus and to find out how the virus first reached different locations.

* https://covidgraph.github.io/[CovidGraph^] is a project working on the integration of publications and molecular data on COVID-19 in a Neo4j graph.

=== Getting Started with the Neo4j BI Connector

This week David Allen and Logan Smith announced the release of the Neo4j BI Connector, a tool that delivers direct access to Neo4j graph data from business intelligence (BI) tools.

The BI Connector lets users write SQL queries from BI tools like Tableau, Looker, TIBCO Spotfire Server, and Microstrategy. These queries are translated to Cypher queries, executed against a Neo4j database, and then return results in tabular form.

If you have any questions or feedback, please send David and Logan an email at ecosystem@neo4j.com.

Rik Van Bruggen @rvanbruggen
Part 2/3 of my experiments with #neo4j in a really cool #supplychainmanagement (#scm) domain: https://blog.bruggen.com/2020/03/supply-chain-management-with-graphs_25.html - really love how easy it is to work with this data in #neo4j.

Part 3/3 of my experiments with #supplychainmanagement (#scm) in #neo4j: applying some #graphalgo love (betweenness, pathfinding, ...) to a supply chain can be very interesting. See https://blog.bruggen.com/2020/03/supply-chain-management-with-graphs_27.html

* Need a Neo4j causal cluster in your integration tests?
I got you covered: https://github.com/michael-simons/junit-jupiter-causal-cluster-testcontainer-extension
Based on @junitteam Jupiter and the amazing @testcontainers project.

* William Lyon @lyonwj
[new blog post] GraphQL ResolveInfo Deep Dive
Building efficient #GraphQL resolvers by generating database queries.
Uses examples from the @neo4j GraphQL integrations, but the concepts apply to any GraphQL API that fetches data from a database.
https://blog.grandstack.io/graphql-resolveinfo-deep-dive-1b3144075866

* To give you a head start for app development with
#Java, #Python #DotNet #JavaScript #Go #GraphQL #SpringBoot and Neo4j
the Neo4j Aura team updated the "how-to-connect" page.
https://console.neo4j.io/#how-to-connect
If you're logged in, you get database specifics injected. Check it out.





* Michael Simons @rotnroll666
Neo4j, reactive database access, JDK 14 records: https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-examples-record-movies
Even relationship mappings work ootb with records.
Thanks @odrotbohm for the Spring record support.
