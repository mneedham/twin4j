Greetings graphistas!

In this week’s edition we watch Risa Myers’ NODES talk where she shares her experiences on teaching Neo4j to students.

Tomaz Bratanic walks us through how to migrate existing code from the Graph Algorithms library to its successor, the Graph Data Science library, based on examples the Graph Algorithms book (which is only available for download until April 15).

Adam Cowley has produced a lot of new content around: taking advantage of multi database in 4.0 through a worked example, how to seed an instance of Neo4j inside a Docker container using a backup, and has built an early version of a Cypher Query builder for Node.js.

Estelle Scifo has released the latest version of neomap, and gives us an overview of the new features in it with her latest blog post.

I hope you have a fabulous weekend!

=== NODES 2019: We are not just relational anymore: Teaching Neo4j as part of a database course

In this week’s video from the https://neo4j.com/online-summit/[NODES 2019^] conference, Risa Myers’ talks about how she has incorporated Neo4j on the syllabus at Rice University. 

youtube::alqm9mRKTVw[type={type}]

She identifies that the focus in a project should be on selecting the right tool for the job, and when thinking about how you store and query your data, this is also applicable. Risa describes the evolution of the course that she runs, and how it has changed over time to incorporate different database types, including Neo4j. 

If teaching Neo4j has whet your appetite, do check out the https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/university-program/[Neo4j GraphAcademy University Program^].

https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^] has recently written a blog post featuring how you can migrate from the Graph Algorithms library to its successor, the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/[Graph Data Science (GDS)^] library, which was released this week as a 1.0 version, soon to be available in Neo4j Desktop. 

He has prepared migration guides in the form of an https://zeppelin.apache.org/[Apache Zeppelin^] notebooks. Using examples from the Graph Algorithms book, Tomaz has produced 16 single graph algorithm notebooks with implementations in Apache Spark as well as in Neo4j. He also covers the link prediction analysis from the book, ported to the new library.

The Graph Data Science library, together with Bloom 1.2 is also available in the new https://neo4j.com/sandbox[Graph Data Science Sandbox^], thanks to Will Lyon.

Don’t forget, if you haven’t already - do download your copy of the link:https://neo4j.com/graph-algorithms-book/?utm_source=twin4j[Graph Algorithms^] book whilst you can - it’s available for free download, but only until 15 April!

*Adam Cowley* just joined our team (yay!). He will be working predominantly in the area of Neo4j Developer Tools (Desktop, Browser, Graph Apps, Visualization). Exciting things to come!

PSA: https://neo4j.com/careers[We are hiring^]!

Meanwhile he’s been keeping himself busy with the following topics:

Adam gives an example of how you can use the 4.0 multi database features through the example of building a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. He shows how you can build a https://adamcowley.co.uk/neo4j/sass-control-panel-graph-app/[lightweight control panel to automate the process of spinning up new databases^].

If you want to take a https://adamcowley.co.uk/neo4j/neo4j-docker-seed-backup/[backup of an existing database, and use it to seed an instance of Neo4j inside a Docker container^], Adam got you covered too.

Last but not least, for those of you using Neo4j with Node.js, he’s put together an early version of a Cypher Query builder, available on https://github.com/adam-cowley/neode-querybuilder[GitHub^]. Please do let Adam know what you think!

https://twitter.com/st3llasia[Estelle Scifo^] recently released 0.4.0 of neomap. If you’ve not come across neomap before, it is a Neo4j Desktop Graph App which allows you to visualize nodes with geographic attributes. You have the flexibility to mark certain artefacts on the map, based on what Cypher query you input into the application.

This is especially powerful when used in combination with the https://neo4j.com/download-center/[Graph Data Science^] library, as Estelle shows us in her latest blog post. 

You can also read more about how neomap https://stellasia.github.io/blog/2019-10-10-global-graph-hack/[came to be^], as Estelle’s (winning!!) entry to last year’s https://neo4j.com/graph-hack-19/[Global GraphHack competition^].

=== Tweet of the Week

Jim Chen has imported the Justices of the US Supreme Court in a Graph with their succession and nomination links to presidents. Really cool!

@rvanbruggen
Just before the weekend: after securing my #beergraph, I managed to separate administrative from investigative access in a #fraud graph as well - thanks to #neo4j 4.0's fine grained access control features. It's really easy and powerful - look at http://blog.bruggen.com/2020/02/securing-sample-fraud-graph-with-neo4j.html

If you missed @mesirii's #YOW19 talk on "How Graphs Help Investigative Journalist to Connect the Dots", you can watch it now... and many other talks from December's conference... on our Youtube channel
