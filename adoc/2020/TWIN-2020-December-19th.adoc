Hi graphistas,

Welcome to the last version of TWIN4j for 2020. We'll be taking a couple of weeks off over Christmas and the New Year, so we'll see you again in 2021!

Our video this week features a couple of talks from the NODES 2020 Extended series. 

Luanne Misquitta shows how to analyse IT Operations data using Hume, Will Lyon builds an Election Dashboard, and Lju Lazarevic launches the New York Central Park sandbox.

And finally, Will Lyon has started building a podcast application with the GRANDstack.

Cheers,
https://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^] and the Developer Relations team

In Will Lyon's latest blog post, he shows how to use low code graph apps to build data visualizations around the US election with Neo4j.

The first part of the post is all about data import, before Will covers the rule based styling feature in Neo4j Bloom, as well as the recently added hierarchical layout. After that he builds some charts using Adam Cowley's Charts Graph App, before conclusion with some spatial visualisations using Neomap.
