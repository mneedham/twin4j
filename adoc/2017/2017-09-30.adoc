=== Online Meetup: Building Conversational Experiences with Amazon Alexa and Neo4j


In this week's https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup[online meetup^] https://twitter.com/graph_aware[GraphAware^]'s https://twitter.com/ikwattro[Christophe Willemsen^] showed us how to combine Amazon Alexa and Neo4j to build great conversational experiences.

You can catch a https://graphconnect2017.sched.com/event/CKsX?iframe=no[live version of this talk^] at http://graphconnect.com/[GraphConnect NYC 2017^]. Christophe will also be hanging out in the DevZone giving demos of the Alexa to anyone who's interested.


=== Graphing metaphors, Building a Source Code Schema, GraphQL and GoT


* https://twitter.com/feststelltaste[Markus Harrer^] continued his series of posts showing how to use jQAssistant and Neo4j for software analytics. This time he shows how to https://www.feststelltaste.de/building-higher-level-abstractions-of-source-code/[build higher-level abstractions of source code^]


* https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] wrote  https://medium.com/@mesirii/importing-mapping-metaphor-into-neo4j-90ac9ead4d44[Importing Mapping Metaphor into Neo4j^], in which he explained how to create a graph of metaphoric connections of the English language and run graph algorithms against it. Michael also created https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY1qp26ooy0[a short video^] showing how to import the data into Neo4j.


* The video of Michael Hunger's talk from the GraphQL Berlin meetup - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9HYUWWF2Sw[A Game of Data and GraphQL^] - is now available. Michael shows how to build a GraphQL schema on top of data loaded from https://anapioficeandfire.com/[An API of Ice and Fire^], load and clean the data using APOC procedures, and then write queries in GraphiQL.


* In https://medium.com/@mesirii/better-data-import-with-graphql-548084a35dfd[Better Data Import with GraphQL^] Michael Hunger explains the https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-cli-load[graphql-cli-load^] tool he's built to make it easier to load data into GraphQL backends. 


* https://twitter.com/mfalcier[Marco Falcier^] released v1.3.0 of https://github.com/h-omer/neo4j-versioner-core/releases/tag/1.3.0[neo4j-versioner-core^], a collection of procedures to help developers manage versioned graphs. This release contains several new procedures to make it easier to do common operations. If you haven't seen neo4j-versioner-core, don't forget to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APC1vptFJoU&index=7&list=PL9Hl4pk2FsvVnz4oi0F8UXiD3nMNqsRO2[Episode #19^] of the online meetup which covered this project.


* Adam Hopkins has written up his experience https://medium.com/@ahop63/my-new-development-stack-using-python-graphql-and-neo4j-the-brewmasters-guide-to-the-internet-87e3879009c4[building an application using GraphQL, Neo4j, and Django^].  


=== Neo4j, Fraud Detection, and Python


The https://www.meetup.com/preview/Data-Science-Milan[Data Science Milan^] group recently https://www.meetup.com/preview/Data-Science-Milan/events/243337281[hosted an event^] which focused on different data science applications that are made possible using graph databases.

The video contains a mix of talks in English and Italian - the one in English is about 50 minutes in so if you're language challenged like me you'll want to skip forwards to there.


=== On the podcast: Tomaz Bratanic


This week on the podcast https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik^] http://blog.bruggen.com/2017/09/podcast-interview-with-tomasz-bratanic.html[interviewed^] https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^], who's written many great blog posts that we've featured in previous versions of TWIN4j.
