[Body copy:]
////
 
Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.
 
This weeks edition is not brought to you by Mark, because he's busy taking care of his extremely cute, newborn daughter.
Congratulations and all the best to your wife and yourself Mark, we're very excited.
 
=== Featured Community Member: Mark Needham
 
That's why I wanted to use the opportunity to feature http://twitter.com/markhneedham[Mark^] himself as this weeks community member.
 
He started as a support engineer at Neo4j helping customers, then became a developer in our clustering team in London building the new Causal Cluster infrastructure and now brings all his enthusiasm into our very own developer relations team.

Ever since he joined Neo4j he http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/category/databases-2/neo4j/[wrote countless articles^], grew the https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/[London meetup^] almost singlehandledly to 3870+ members, organized many hackathons, took care of the http://neo4j.com/graphacademy[Neo4j training classes^] and started the https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Online Meetup^].
And for more than 4 months now he compiles all the goodness of our community into 
 
 
On behalf of everyone at Neo4j and in the community, thanks for all your work Mark!
 
This week we could welcome the 5000th member (Eddie Fuller) to our http://neo4j.com/developer/slack[neo4j-users Slack^] the place to be when you have questions or answers around Neo4j and related projects.

=== Online Meetup: OGMNeo a JavaScript Object Graph Mapper for Neo4j
 
In this week's online meetup http://twitter.com/LucianoPassos11[Luciano Almeida^], presented his https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdIWjNXSELM[JavaScript object graph mapper for Neo4j^] that aims to make building JavaScript applications easier. Besides CRUD functionality, it also provides a Cypher-DSL, DTO and DAO support.
 
He also demonstrated an example application that used the OGM to drive a REST (Swagger) and GraphQL API.
 
// youtube::YdIWjNXSELM[type={type}]

 
You can find the repository here: https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida/OGMNeo and the demo here: https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida/ogmneo-demo.
 
If you wrote an Object Graph Mapper for Neo4j please reach out to us, we plan another event with a few different OGMs for different languages or approaches and perhaps a discussion between the authors.
 
Our upcoming Online meetups are also not to miss:

=== From The Knowledge Base
 
This week from the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we have 3 posts:
 
* https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/performing-match-intersection/[Performing match intersection^] Andrew Bowman discusses approaches to find nodes that are related to a set of input nodes
* https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/redirect-neo4j-logs-to-sysout-using-rsyslog/[Redirect Neo4j logs to sysout^] Jose Rosa describes how to use rsyslog to achieve a unified Neo4j logging under Linux
* Sometimes you quickly need to check port availability and connectivity. In https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/a-light-weight-approach-to-validating-network-port-connectivity/[A light weight approach to validating network port connectivity^] Dana Canzano describes some ways of doing that.
 
=== Next Week
 
What’s happening next week in the world of graph databases?
 
It seems summer and holiday season has finally started and there are not too many events. So get out, enjoy the sun and have fun with your friends and family.
 
Our https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/240545673[next week's Online Meetup^] will feature Greg Walker who demonstrates how he solved importing and querying the Bitcoin blockchain in Neo4j. The import code is available in Greg's https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-to-neo4j[bitcoin-to-neo4j^] library if you want to take a sneak peek before the session. 
 
=== Tweet of the Week
 
https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] observed at the IRE17 journalism conference, how journalists from the Washington Post and the ICIJ explained their use of Neo4j in investigative journalism.
