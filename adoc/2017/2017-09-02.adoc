Felienne Hermans - This Week's Featured Community Member
</strong>
</p>
++++
Felienne became known in the Neo4j community for her popular talk 'spreadsheets are graphs', which she presented at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAHJUcGXmZA[GraphConnect Europe 2015^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cdgew5zvI4[GOTO Berlin 2015^], and several other conferences and meetups. You can also read a https://neo4j.com/blog/spreadsheets-are-graphs-too/[transcript of the talk^] if you're not a fan of video content.


Felienne uses Neo4j to do graph analysis on spreadsheets to help find code smells and areas of spreadsheets that need refactoring. She explains this in detail in her http://blog.bruggen.com/2015/11/podcast-interview-with-felienne-hermans.html[interview on Rik Van Bruggen's Graphistania podcast^].


And this week Felienne achieved tenure!

On behalf of the Neo4j community, congratulations Felienne and thanks for all your work!


=== Graph of Thrones, Salesforce, Fraud Analysis


* https://twitter.com/jhomarolo[Jhonathan de Souza^] https://codigosimples.net/2017/08/31/slides-da-palestra-graph-of-thrones-neo4j-game-of-thrones/[shared the slides^] from "Graph of Thrones – Neo4j + Game of Thrones". This one's in Portuguese and if you're having Game of Thrones withdrawal symptoms now that Season 7 is over you can always watch our https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmBP-jz7CBc[Graph of Thrones online meetup^] from a couple of weeks ago.


* https://github.com/gaskaj[Joe Gaska^] has created https://github.com/HardingPoint/graphconnect[graphconnect^], which allows you to quickly connect your Salesforce objects to the https://www.hardingpoint.com/[Harding Point^] object graph. Harding Point then uses an AI powered neural network to find hidden paths to revenue, cost savings, and reduce operational burden.


* Bobby Narang wrote up https://www.sendergen.com/salesforce-bay-area-developer-recap[his experience attending the Streamsets + Salesforce + Neo4j meetup^] in San Francisco last week. This one was recorded so you can https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL_lKpurMkk[watch it on our YouTube channel^] if you weren't able to attend in person.


*  Elise Devaux explains how https://linkurio.us/blog/bforbank-detects-fraud-with-linkurious/[BforBank detects and investigates fraud faster with Linkurious and Neo4j^], which includes this quote by https://www.bforbank.com/[BforBank^]'s Alexandre Dressayre:  "several factors motivated the choice of the Linkurious solution, notably the bundle offered by the company. An off-the-shelf visualization and analysis software along with the Neo4j graph database solution was a perfect fit for us."


=== Online Meetup: Analysing the football transfer window


In this week's online meetup https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Jesús Barrasa^] and I tried to figure out what's been going on in this http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40762417[crazy football transfer window^] with the help of graphs.

youtube::MxOJW7X8GHs[type={type}]


We showed how to import CSV data, clean it up, make implicit relationships explicit, and find some unexpected insights using the Cypher query language.


In next week's online meetup https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] will show us the https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/242821512/[new Neo4j graph algorithms library^] that was released a few weeks ago.


=== Work Order Management, Kotlin Procedures, Graphing Causal Events


* https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^] wrote https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/08/25/work-order-management-with-neo4j/[Work Order Management with Neo4j^] in which he shows how to build an evented work order model.


* https://twitter.com/thedevel[Byron Ruth^] shows how to use https://nats.io/documentation/streaming/nats-streaming-intro/[NATS Streaming^] with https://twitter.com/Minio[Minio^] and Neo4j for causal graphing of events in a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMEz-G0FqaQ[short YouTube video^].


* https://twitter.com/mfalcier[Marco Falcier^] has created https://github.com/mfalcier/neo4j-kotlin-procedure-example[neo4j-kotlin-procedure-example^], in which he shows how to create a Neo4j stored procedure using the Jetbrains' Kotlin programming language.


* On StackOverflow I found a https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45957637/finding-indirect-paths-between-two-nodes-in-neo4j[couple of^] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45919620/cypher-match-path-with-different-depths[interesting questions^] where the answer requires you to use http://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/syntax/patterns/#cypher-pattern-varlength[variable length pattern matching^]. This is one of the most fun features to use in Cypher, so have a look and see if you need those types of queries in your application.
