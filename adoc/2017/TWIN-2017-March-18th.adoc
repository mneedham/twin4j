<h3>Wordpress recommendation engine</h3><br />

Adam Cowley - https://twitter.com/adamcowley has been busy this week building a Neo4j based recommendation engine for Wordpress https://github.com/adam-cowley/neo4j-wordpress . <br /><br />

You can follow his work in a 3 part blog series:<br /><br />

Markus Harrer - https://twitter.com/feststelltastehas written another couple of interesting blog posts. In the first he shows how to combine neo4j and Python’s pandas library http://pandas.pydata.org/ to find the top committers in a github repository https://www.feststelltaste.de/committer-distribution/ . There’s lots of data wrangling and cleansing along the way.   

In his second post Markus summarises his experiences working with jQAssistant https://www.feststelltaste.de/my-experiences-with-jqassistant-so-far/ . It’s a pretty good resource for all things software analytics. Michael Hunger also has a blog post from a few years ago where he shows how to use jQAssistant and other OSS tools http://jexp.de/blog/2014/06/geekout-software-analytics-with-graphs/ 

Ryan Boyd wrote a blog post about moving RDBMS data into the graph  - http://www.developeradvocate.com/2017/03/rdbms-to-graph-database/ using the apoc.load.jdbc procedure. Ryan also presented a webinar on this topic late last week: <br /><br />

I missed an excellent post by Romain Thalineau where he shows how to monitor the French Presidential Election on Twitter using Python and Neo4j https://medium.freecodecamp.com/monitoring-the-french-presidential-election-on-twitter-with-python-6a2a9310e6f4#.8slfi8pmv 



This week I decided to do some exploration of Neo4j projects on github that haven’t necessarily surface on twitter. I queried the Neo4j community graph https://github.com/community-graph  to find the most recent projects. 

From the old school. Visual Basic and Neo4j! https://github.com/Kmahmoudi/neo4j_visual_basic

Nathan Danielsen - Loading US FEC 2016 Data into Neo4j
https://github.com/ndanielsen/fec-2016-neo4j 


Gert Sallaerts https://github.com/Gertt created neo4j-retried
https://github.com/ambassify/neo4j-retried which allows the user to automatically retry queries and handle DeadlockDetected exceptions more cleanly. 

Tom Shafer https://github.com/tomshafer created neo4j-db-manager https://github.com/tomshafer/neo4j-db-manager , a neat little tool for working with multiple local databases.
