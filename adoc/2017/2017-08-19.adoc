=== Thinking in Graphs, OWL to Neo4j, Analysing event data


* https://twitter.com/danwoodsearly[Dan Woods^] wrote https://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2017/08/17/learning-to-think-in-graphs-a-task-for-every-business#3070ef7370ef[Learning To Think In Graphs: A Task For Every Business^] in which he suggests that businesses need to learn to think about questions in terms of graphs. He goes on to point out the success that Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn have had by thinking about data in just this way. 


* Massimiliano Izzo created https://github.com/ISA-tools/FAIRsharing-Owl2Neo[FAIRsharing-Owl2Neo^] for importing data in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language[OWL format^] into Neo4j for the https://fairsharing.org/[FAIRsharing project^], which is a curated, informative and educational resource on data and metadata standards, across all disciplines, inter-related to databases and data policies.


* Our friends at https://snowplowanalytics.com[Snowplow Analytics^] are back after a few years, and https://twitter.com/dilyan_damyanov[Dilyan Damyanov^] has written an article showing how to https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2017/07/17/loading-and-analysing-snowplow-event-data-in-Neo4j/[load and analyze event data in Neo4j^]. If you've ever wanted to analyse the paths that users take through your website or find out how people get to certain pages this is the article for you.

=== Intro to Cypher


We didn't have an online meetup this week so our video of the week is an Intro to Cypher presented by my colleague https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^]. 

youtube::pMjwgKqMzi8[type={type}]


If you're new to Neo4j or the https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/[Cypher query language^] this is a great starting point. 
Will takes you on a journey where he uses data from the https://www.yelp.co.uk/dataset_challenge[Yelp Dataset Challenge^] to introduce the graph data model, import the data into Neo4j, and then run queries against it

=== Swagger UI for Intermine, The Note taking graph, Hybrid recommendations


* Yash Sharma wrote http://yasharmaster.github.io/blog/2017/documenting-intermine-neo4j-api-with-swagger/[Documenting InterMine-Neo4j API with Swagger UI^], which talks about the http://intermine-neo4jwebapp.herokuapp.com/[Swagger API^] created so that https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes[BlueGenes^] can be configured to work with it easily in future.


* https://twitter.com/cotoami[Cotoami^] is an experimental note-taking app which advertises itself as a place where people can weave a large network of wisdom from tiny ideas and uses Neo4j to store some of the data. You can find the https://github.com/cotoami/cotoami[code on GitHub^] and try it out at https://cotoa.me[cotoa.me].


* https://github.com/marcusmchale[Marcus McHale^] created a https://github.com/marcusmchale/breedcafs[Flask based web portal to the Neo4j database^] for http://www.cirad.fr/en/news/all-news-items/articles/2017/science/breedcafs-new-coffee-varieties-for-agroforestry[BREEDCAFS^], an EU research project adapting coffee varieties for agroforestry. 


* Damiano Cancemi created https://github.com/damianoc90/Hybrid-Recommendation-System[Hybrid-Recommendation-System^] which shows how to do content based and collaborative filtering using R and Neo4j for car selling. It's a bit of a work in progress but there are still some good ideas to take away.
