////


Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days. 


This week we look at how to create a Twitter clone using Neo4j, the Neo4j Data Science stack, learning Chinese, and much more!

Tomaz only recently came onto the Neo4j scene but has been quick to get going and blogs about Neo4j at an incredible rate.


Over the last few weeks these are some of Tomaz's posts:


* link:https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/neo4j-apoc-triggers-and-web-apis/[Neo4j APOC triggers and web APIs, window="_blank"] 
* link:https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/04/01/neo4j-location-trees/[Neo4j Location Trees, window="_blank"]
* link:https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/04/01/neo4j-to-gephi/[Neo4j to Gephi, window="_blank"]
* link:https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/04/02/cypher-location-queries/[Cypher Location queries, window="_blank"]


Tomaz also created the link:https://github.com/tomasonjo/hospitals-neo4j[hospitals-neo4j, window="_blank"] project which brings together the above blog posts while analysing a hospital dataset.

Tomaz has also created a Neo4j browser guide which you can try out by executing the following command in the query window of your Neo4j browser:

<pre data-lang=”cypher” class=”code programlisting cm-s-neo”>
:play http://guides.neo4j.com/contrib/hospital.html
</pre>

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks Tomaz! I'm looking forward to see what else you come up with for link:https://neo4j.com/blog/april-is-apoc-awareness-month/[APOC Awareness month, window="_blank"]. 


=== Building a Twitter Clone with Neo4j


link:https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi, window="_blank"] has written a new series of posts showing how to build a Twitter clone with Neo4j. 


* link:https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/03/30/building-a-twitter-clone-with-neo4j-part-one/[Part One, window="_blank"] in which Max explains his approach to Neo4j POCs and designs an initial graph model. 
* link:https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/04/03/building-a-twitter-clone-with-neo4j-part-two/[Part Two, window="_blank"] in which Max shows how to build a Twitter-esque HTTP API and create/retrieve users.  
* link:https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/04/04/building-a-twitter-clone-with-neo4j-part-three/[Part Three, window="_blank"] in which Max adds functionality to follow other users and see who we've followed and who's followed us.
* link:https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/04/05/building-a-twitter-clone-with-neo4j-part-four/[Part Four, window="_blank"] in which Max adds functionality to add tags and edit posts (a feature Twitter doesn't actually have!) 


=== Automated static malware analysis using Neo4j


The link:https://twitter.com/malwaregroup[MalwareGroup, window="_blank"] posted a really cool talk by Marion Marscalek and Raphael Vinot in which they show how to combine Neo4j and radare to analyse malware.

Modelling the Chinese language in Neo4j
</strong>
</p>
++++


On my GitHub travels I came across the following projects which are worth a look:


* link:https://twitter.com/diegomrodz[Diego Rodrigues, window="_blank"] created  link:https://github.com/diegomrodz/chinese_exp[chinese_exp, window="_blank"] where he shows how to use data to explore and learn the Chinese language. Fernando Izquierdo also link:https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/9797-neo4j-february-meetup[presented on the same topic, window="_blank"] at the London meetup a couple of months ago.

*  Marco Falcierhas has been building on top of link:https://twitter.com/ikwattro[Christophe Willemsen]'s link:https://github.com/mfalcier/laravel-neo4j-php-ogm-example[Laravel Neo4j PHP OGM example project, window="_blank"] .  


* Christophe himself created link:https://github.com/ikwattro/neo4j-ogm-symfony-security[neo4j-ogm-symfony-security, window="_blank"], where he creates a quick PoC showing how to use a custom UserProvider backed by a Neo4j database. 


* Bogdans Afonins combines link:https://laravel.com/[Laravel, window="_blank"] and link:https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-php-ogm[Neo4j PHP OGM, window="_blank"]
in the link:https://github.com/bafonins/SpringMVC-Neo4j-App[SpringMVC-Neo4j-App, window="_blank"] project. 


* link:https://github.com/fancellu[Dino Fancellu, window="_blank"] created link:https://github.com/fancellu/neo4j-d3v4[neo4j-d3v4, window="_blank"], a proof of concept project that gets data via the Javascript driver and feeds it into a d3 v4 force simulation. 


=== From The Knowledge Base


The link:https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base, window="_blank"] is a collection of Frequently Asked Questions maintained by Neo4j's Customer Success team. 


If you're doing some hands on work with Neo4j, at some stage you'll want to port the users/roles and constraints/indexes from your staging environment to production. 


The following articles describe queries that will automatically generate Cypher statements to do this and save you having to rebuild them from scratch.

=== Next Week


So what's there happening next week in the world of graphs? 


* On Saturday April 8th, 2017 Nigel Small will present link:https://pydata.org/amsterdam2017/schedule/presentation/26/[A Pythonic Tour of Neo4j and the Cypher Query Language, window="_blank"] at link:https://pydata.org/amsterdam2017/[PyData Amsterdam, window="_blank"]. 
* On Thursday April 13th, 2017 Michael Hunger and I are going to run link:https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/238920813/[APOC Office Hours, window="_blank"] as part of April APOC Awareness month. If you have any APOC questions and/or are taking part in the competition come along and ask us anything. 


=== Tweets of the Week


My favorite tweet this week was by link:https://twitter.com/tmanning[@tmanning, window="_blank"] who spent last weekend modelling Whitehouse personal financial disclosures documents in Neo4j as part of a link:https://twitter.com/data4democracy[Data4Democracy,window="_blank"] event.
