This Week in Neo4j – 24 June 2017

////


Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days. 


This week we look at how to create a Neo4j powered Alexa bot, analysing the Neo4j community on twitter, and a write up from the life sciences and healthcare workshop.

Daniel has appeared http://blog.bruggen.com/2016/08/podcast-interview-with-daniel.html[interviewed on the Graphistania podcast^] and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwhAlNgjvMA[spoke about Hetionet at GraphConnect San Francisco 2016^].


More text + thank them for their work.


=== Neo4j life sciences and healthcare workshop in Berlin


Often invisible to the people outside of the field, life-science researchers have been embracing graph databases instead of the traditional triple- and relational-stores.


This week https://twitter.com/aethelraed[Petra Selmer^] and http://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] invited life-science and healthcare researchers and practitioners to Berlin to share their experiences in a full day workshop.

And a full day it was: link:https://www.eventbrite.com/e/neo4j-life-health-sciences-day-berlin-tickets-33238223421#[11 planned and 3 ad-hoc presentations and 2 longer workshops^], covering everything from genome, proteome, pathway and systems biology model databases and interactions to actual drug development efforts and plans for improving healthcare, all with the help of graphs.


We were stunned by the breadth of applications and by the enthusiasm and happiness of the presenters. 


Thank you so much to everyone for presenting, discussing and attending, we will definitely run similar events elsewhere and possibly coordinated with the industry conferences. 
We will publish a longer blog post about the event and also proper proceedings.




=== Analysing Neo4j tweets, IEEE Graph Challenge, Neo4j Alexa Chatbot


* https://twitter.com/ikwattro[Christophe Willemsen^] shared the slides from https://fr.slideshare.net/christophewillemsen/chatbots-and-voice-conversational-interfaces-with-amazon-alexa-neo4j-and-graphaware-nlp[Chatbots and Voice Conversational Interfaces with Amazon Alexa, Neo4j and GraphAware NLP] which was presented at the https://www.meetup.com/Graph-Database-Czech-Republic/[Neo4j Czech Republic meetup^] last week. 


* In https://blog.godatadriven.com/dont-be-a-lonely-document[Don't be a lonely document^] https://twitter.com/rweverwijk[Ron van Weverwijk^] shows how to analyse the GraphConnect/Neo4j tags on twitter and discovers that https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik Van Bruggen^] is the most retweeted person in the community. 


* The IEEE launched http://graphchallenge.mit.edu/darpa-hive[Graph Challenge^], which aims to provide a well-defined community venue for stimulating research and highlighting innovations in graph analysis software, hardware, algorithms, and systems. You've got until 1st July if you want to submit something. 


* Yash Sharma explains how InterMine are http://yasharmaster.github.io/blog/2017/path-query-cypher-puzzle/[converting PathQuery queries into Cypher^] as part of a a prototype of InterMine which uses Neo4j database at the backend.
 
* Kevin Tardivel wrote https://sonra.io/2017/06/12/benefits-graph-databases-data-warehousing/?d=1[What are the Benefits of Graph Databases in Data Warehousing?^] in which he talks about the benefits of using graphs for data lineage, data orchestration, data cataloguing, and master data management. 


=== Online Meetup:


In this week’s online meetup https://twitter.com/npontikos[Nikolas Pontikos^] showed us Pheno4J - a gene to phenotype graph databases created to make it easier to analyze human DNA and genetic mutations.

You can also find the code in the https://github.com/phenopolis/pheno4j[pheno4j^] repository on GitHub.


=== From The Knowledge Base


This week from the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we have an article showing how to use https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/amazon-cloudwatch-configuration-for-neo4j-logs/[Amazon CloudWatch to monitor Neo4j logs^].


And if you're planning to deploy Neo4j on AWS, we've recently created a guide showing how to https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-cloud-aws-ec2-ami/[install Neo4j using a custom AMI with AWS command line tools^].

=== Next Week


What’s happening next week in the world of graph databases?


* On Wednesday June 28th, 2017 Jhonathan Soares will be presenting https://www.meetup.com/nosqlsp/events/240846850/[an introduction to Neo4j^] at the https://www.meetup.com/nosqlsp/[NoSQL Sao Paulo meetup^]. 


* Also on Wednesday June 28th, 2017 https://twitter.com/danielabutano[Daniela Butano^] and https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Jesús Barrasa^] will be presenting at the https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/240602643/[Neo4j London meetup^]. Daniela will explain how Intermine use graph databases to explore biological data models and Jesus will debunk some RDF-vs-Property Graph fake news. 


* On Thursday June 29th, 2017 Luciano Almeida will present https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/240603466/[OGMNeo - building an Object Graph Mapper for Node.js^] at the https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online meetup^].
