Jonathan most recently presented https://www.meetup.com/windy-city-graphdb/events/240348871/[400 trash bags of grocery receipts + Neo4j^] at the https://www.meetup.com/windy-city-graphdb/[Neo4j Chicago meetup^], in which he analysed Instacart's open dataset using Neo4j, 


More text + thank them for their work.


=== Natural Language Understanding with Neo4j


In this week’s online meetup https://twitter.com/hyperparticle[Dan Kondratyuk^] showed us Graph NLU - a project he built to understand natural language dialogue in an interactive setting by representing memory of previous dialogue states using a persistent graph

You can also find the code in the https://github.com/Hyperparticle/graph-nlu[graph-nlu^] repository on GitHub.


https://twitter.com/Phil_Gooch[Phil Gooch^] presented https://www.meetup.com/textanalytics/events/240960410/[Graph databases and text analytics^] at the https://www.meetup.com/textanalytics/[London Text Analytics^] meetup. The code from Phil's talk is available in the https://github.com/philgooch/neo4j-nlp[neo4j-nlp^] GitHub repository.


=== Game of Thrones, GraphQL, Cuckoo Filters, Mulesoft


* Just in time for Season 7 of Game of Thrones this week, https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaž Bratanič^] has written the 4th post of his https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/game-of-thrones-part-4-analysis/[GoT analysis series^]. In this post Tomas looks at allegiances between houses and finds communities of people who have fought together.


* https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] has written an article for O'Reilly showing how to https://www.oreilly.com/learning/building-a-simple-graphql-server-with-neo4j[build a GraphQL server using Neo4j^]. Will contrasts GraphQL with REST based APIs and shows how to wire up a GraphQL application that uses the https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/[Neo4j recommendations sandbox^] as its source of data.


* https://twitter.com/nathannam[Nathan Nam^] showed how to create a demo application using the https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/connectivity-dev/anypoint-connector-neo4j/[Neo4j connector for Mulesoft^]. 


* https://twitter.com/GeekRuthie[Ruth Holloway^] wrote the first of a multi part series - https://opensource.com/article/17/7/fundamentals-graph-databases-neo4j[Fundamentals of graph databases with Neo4j^]. If you're just getting started with graphs this is a great place to start.


* https://twitter.com/adamcowley[Adam Cowley^] shows how to load http://www.adamcowley.co.uk/neo4j/loading-tweets-into-neo4j-with-apoc/[Twitter data into Neo4j using the APOC library^]. Adam shows how to get setup with a token for the twitter API, before making calls to the https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/show/id[/statuses API endpoint^] to pull Twitter data into the graph via the https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_load_json_2[apoc.load.json procedure^].


* Joanna Bitton created https://github.com/jbitton/neo4j-graph-renderer[neo4j-graph-renderer^] - a React component that can be used to render a Neo4j graph. 


* https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max de Marzi^] shows how to https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/07/13/using-a-cuckoo-filter-for-unique-relationships/[use a cuckoo filter for unique relationships^]. A cuckoo filter is a probabilistic data structure that in this case results in 50x higher throughput when searching for duplicate relationships.
* Łukasz Szeremeta created https://github.com/lszeremeta/neo4j-sparql-extension-yars[neo4j-sparql-extension-yars^] - a Neo4j unmanaged extension that provides RDF storage and SPARQL 1.1 query features. 


=== From The Knowledge Base


This week from the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we have an article showing how to https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/a-light-weight-approach-to-validating-network-port-connectivity/[easily validate network port connectivity^] on your Neo4j clusters.


=== Next Week


On Wednesday, July 19, 2017 https://twitter.com/technige[Nigel Small^], Tech Lead of the Neo4j Drivers Team, will be presenting https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/240413579/[An introduction to Neo4j Bolt Drivers^] as part of the Neo4j online meetup.


Don't forget to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UixTSyGfAxU[join us on YouTube^] for that one.
