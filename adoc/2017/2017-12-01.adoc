Daniel also presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwhAlNgjvMA[lightning talk^] on the same topic at GraphConnect SF 2016. He also wrote an https://neo4j.com/blog/integrating-biology-public-neo4j-database/[accompanying blog post^].


=== Geocoding Paradise Papers, Graphs for Telecoms, Graph Algorithms


* In http://www.lyonwj.com/2017/11/28/geocoding-paradise-papers-neo4j-spatial-visualization/[Geocoding Paradise Papers Addresses In Neo4j To Build Interactive Geographical Data Visualizations^] my colleague https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] shows how to retrieve detailed address information from Google's geocoding API using an APOC procedure. He then builds several visualizations using http://leafletjs.com/[Leaflet.js^]. 


* In https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^]'s latest blog post he shows how to https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2017/11/27/neo4j-graph-algorithms-projecting-a-virtual-graph/[run graph algorithms over a projected movie graph^]. 


* https://twitter.com/prgarnett[Dr Philip Garnett^] has written a https://www.prgarnett.net/daniel-morgan-murder/[really interesting blog post^] where he builds a graph containing people, companies, and organisations related to the http://www.untoldmurder.com/book-1/[murder of Daniel Morgan^]. Philip also runs the http://algorithmicindexing.net/[Algorithmic Indexing^] research project, which aims to integrate open source text processing tools to assist with the analysis, navigation, and reading of large document based data sets.


* My colleague https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Jesús Barrasa^]  presented a webinar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPI1Als3Jv8[Graph Solutions for Telecoms^], in which he shows how to use graphs to solve common problems in the telecoms domain such as finding single points of failure, fraud detection, and root cause analysis.


=== Paradise Papers at ada_CONF


My colleague https://github.com/Lojjs[Louise Söderström^] explained how we build the Cypher query language as well as covering common graph use cases in a talk at https://twitter.com/ada_conf[ada_CONF^].
