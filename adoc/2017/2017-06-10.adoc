Lorenzo has been part of the Neo4j community since 2013 and prefers graph databases over other NoSQL databases because of their flexible and expressive connected data model.

Lorenzo's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0teVUF9NCdU[spoken^] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkXq66zSXPk[multiple times^] at GraphConnect conferences and he has team at LARUS are very active members in the community.

Thanks you Lorenzo and team for all your work on behalf of the Neo4j community!


=== Visualizing crime patterns data as a graph


Christian Miles wrote an article showing how to combine Neo4j and Keylines to https://cambridge-intelligence.com/visualizing-crime-patterns-data-graph[visualize crime patterns data as a graph^].

In the post Christian imports data from the https://data.boston.gov/group/public-safety[data.boston.gov^] initiative into Neo4j using https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_load_json[APOC's Load JSON procedure^], before analysing it by district and crime category. 


He goes on to add generated people, phone, and vehicle data to the graph to simulate the type of investigation a police officer might undertake.


=== Game of Thrones, Fighting Financial Crime, H2O


* Swapnil Kumar has built a https://medium.com/@swapnil31kgp/graph-of-thrones-3cbddf0eec74[Game of Thrones graph^] in preparation for Season 7 which should be released in the next month or so. 


* The https://twitter.com/NfqAdvisory[NfqAdvisory^] team wrote up their experience of a http://nfq.es/en/blog/graph-databases-and-fraud-detection/[Graph Databases applied to Fraud Detection^] event in Spain. 


* https://twitter.com/intercax[Intercax^] released version 3.1 of http://intercax.com/products/syndeia[Syndeia^] - a software platform for integrated model-based engineering - which now allows users to generate graphs from SysML models or/and its interconnections to model elements in other enterprise repositories. Users can then execute Cypher queries on these graphs to make sense of the data.


* Giovanni T. Parra put the code for https://boardthreads.com/[boardthreads.com^] - a service that used Mailgun and Neo4j to turn a Trello board/list into a helpdesk - https://github.com/fiatjaf/boardthreads[on GitHub^] after deciding to shut it down.


* https://twitter.com/elise_deux[Elise Devaux^], Marketing Project Manager at https://twitter.com/Linkurious[Linkurious^], explains how graphs can be used to http://www.analyticbridge.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/fighting-financial-crimes-and-money-laundering-with-graph-data?xg_source=activity[fight financial crimes and money laundering^]. Elise shows how you can setup a fraud watch-list to keep you informed when money laundering patterns occur and then use Linkurious' graph visualization interface to investigate and assess the different cases.


* http://www.graphadvantage.com/author/michael-moore/[Michael Moore^] created https://github.com/graphadvantage/neo4j-h2o-template[neo4j-h2o-template^], which contains a set of iPython notebooks that show how to combine Neo4j with https://www.h2o.ai/[H2O.ai^] - the open source machine learning platform.


=== From The Knowledge Base


This week from the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we have a couple of https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/post-union-processing/[workarounds for the lack of post UNION processing in Cypher^].


=== openCypher: Transactions and Analytics with Neo4j and Cypher for Spark 


We're releasing roughly one video a day from http://graphconnect.com/gc2017-europe/[GraphConnect Europe 2017^], and this week saw the release of the openCypher talk given by Alastair Green, https://twitter.com/boggle[Stefan Plantikow^], and https://twitter.com/aethelraed[Petra Selmer^].

In the talk they cover using Cypher for OLTP workloads on Neo4j and OLAP workloads on Spark. They also propose a syntax for multi graph queries and the ability to return graphs from Cypher.
