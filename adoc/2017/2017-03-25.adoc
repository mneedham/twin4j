=== Featured Community Member: Johannes Unterstein

This week's featured community member is Mesosphere's link:https://twitter.com/unterstein[Johannes Unterstein^].
In link:https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/238023188/[last week's online meetup, window="_blank"] Johannes showed us how to get a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/causal-clustering/?ref=twin4j[Neo4j causal cluster, window="_blank"] up and running on link:https://dcos.io/[DC/OS, window="_blank"].

This was the culmination of several weeks effort where Johannes started with the Neo4j docker image, figured out how to get it to play nicely with the link:http://mesos.apache.org/[Mesos, window="_blank"] ecosystem, and created a link:https://github.com/mesosphere/universe[Mesosphere Universe, window="_blank"] package so that users can easily create Neo4j clusters via the Marathon scheduler.

On top of this Johannes has been a part of the Neo4j community since 2013 and has organized several meetups as well as writing a link:https://libraries.io/github/unterstein/play-2.5-sdn-4.1[Play Framework integration, window="_blank"] for link:https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/[Spring Data Neo4j, window="_blank"].

On behalf of the Neo4j community I'd like to thank Johannes for all his efforts and I'm looking forward to link:http://graphconnect.com/speaker/johannes-unterstein/[your talk, window="_blank"] at link:http://graphconnect.com/[Graph Connect Europe, window="_blank"] on 11th May 2017!

=== Using graph visualization to explore corruption in Egypt and FIFA

There were a couple of interesting posts showing how to use graph visualizations to explore two different types of corruption.

Lana Chan wrote link:https://blog.tomsawyer.com/what-do-big-data-paris-and-the-panama-papers-have-in-common[What Do Big Data Paris and the Panama Papers Have In Common?, window="_blank"].
In this post Lana shows how you can use the link:https://twitter.com/tsawyersoftware[Tom Sawyer, window="_blank"] visualization tool to explore the link:https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160403-ethics-fifa-scandal.html[2015 FIFA corruption scandal, window="_blank"].

Noonpost, an interactive Arabic media website, explain how they used link:https://linkurio.us/[Linkurious, window="_blank"] for link:https://linkurio.us/data-driven-investigation-egyptian-army-influence/[large-scale investigations in a project on Egyptâ€™s corruption networks, window="_blank"].

In the post they explain how they were able to explore connections between the army and its affiliates across various influence networks including the health, food, and tourism sectors using a combination of link:https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/?ref=twin4j[Cypher, window="_blank"] queries and graph visualizations.

There's lots of good stuff in both of these posts if you're interested in data journalism.

If you'd like to do data journalism work using Neo4j but don't know how *sign up for the link:https://neo4j.com/graph-database-data-journalism-accelerator-program/?ref=twin4j[Neo4j data journalism accelerator program, window="_blank"]* and you'll get the opportunity to work with engineers from Neo4j's Developer Relations team to get your analysis up and running.

=== Visual Graph Modeling and Importing

link:https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger, window="_blank"] created a video showing how to sketch graph models and load them into Neo4j using link:https://twitter.com/apcj[Alistair Jones, window="_blank"]' link:http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/[arrows tool, window="_blank"].

You can also do link:https://twitter.com/graphcommons/status/844552279214706690[something similar, window="_blank"] using the link:https://graphcommons.com/[GraphCommons visualization library, window="_blank"].

link:https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon, window="_blnak"] presented a webinar late last week where he showed how to link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXziS-PPIUA&feature=youtu.be[model and import real-world datasets using Neo4j, window="_blank"].

Will shows how to import data from Yelp using several different approaches:

* link:https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_load_json[apoc.load.json, window="_blank"] - a procedure from the link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases[APOC, window="_blank"] library that can import JSON data directly.
* link:https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/?ref=twin4j[LOAD CSV, window="_target"] - a Cypher command for importing CSV files. Works well up to ~10 million rows.
* link:http://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/import/?ref=twin4j[neo4j-import, window="_blank"] - a tool for importing large initial datasets.

Will also talks about Neo4j's user defined procedures and functions, and if you're interested in creating your own ones we've created a couple of new pages on the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/?ref=twin4j[Neo4j developer site, window="_blank"] to help you get started:

This is a multi part interview so stay tuned for more next week!

* link:https://twitter.com/dirkmahler[Dirk Mahler, window="_blank"] released link:http://buschmais.github.io/extended-objects/doc/0.8.0/neo4j/[version 0.8, window="_blank"] of the object graph mapping library for Java extended-objects.
It now supports the Bolt protocol which was introduced in Neo4j 3.0.

* link:https://twitter.com/hoppyokapi[Amanda Schaffer, window="_blank"] posted link:https://bitbucket.org/amschaff/wta_hikes/src/cf7d731d6c1db59794200955a259fe12f4b875ba/Neo4j_PyLadies_d1.pdf[slides, window="_blank"] and link:https://bitbucket.org/amschaff/wta_hikes[code, window="_blank"] from link:https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-PyLadies/events/238145395/[last week's talk at pyladies Seattle, window="_blank"].
Amanda's created a hiking recommendation engine which uses content based filtering based on features (e.g. lakes, waterfalls) that hikes have in common.
There's even a bit of web scraping of the link:http://www.wta.org/go-outside/hikes[WTA, window="_blank"] using Python's link:https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/[beautifulsoup, window="_blank"] library.

Max shows how to use the trusty RoaringBitmap to write a user defined procedure that short circuits as soon as possible when searching across multiple facets.

* Shusei Tomonaga link:http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2017/03/malware-clustering-using-impfuzzy-and-network-analysis---impfuzzy-for-neo4j-.html[wrote about a malware clustering and network analysis tool, windows="_blank"] called link:https://github.com/JPCERTCC/aa-tools/tree/master/impfuzzy/impfuzzy_for_Neo4j[impfuzzy, window="_blank"] that can be used to visualize and look for similar pieces of malware using Neo4j.
The similarity score is calculated using the link:http://perso.uclouvain.be/vincent.blondel/research/louvain.html[Louvain community detection, window="_blank"] and link:https://github.com/JPCERTCC/aa-tools/tree/master/impfuzzy[Fuzzy Hash, window="_blank"] algorithms.

* Pavel Yakovlev released link:https://github.com/zmactep/hasbolt#readme[version 0.1.1.2, window="_blank"] of hasbolt, a Haskell driver for Neo4j.
