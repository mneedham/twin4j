This Week in Neo4j – 1 April 2017


[Body copy:]
////


Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days. 


It's a varied episode this week - we've got a worm's neuronal wiring graph, bitcoin explorers, a link:http://www.datakind.org/[DataKind, window="_blank"] DeepDive, and more. 


=== Featured Community Member: Christophe Willemsen


This week’s featured community member is link:https://twitter.com/ikwattro[Christophe Willemsen], Principal Consultant at Neo4j Solutions Partner link:http://graphaware.com/[GraphAware, window="_blank"].


Christophe came to fame in the Neo4j community by creating link:http://graphgen.graphaware.com/#/[Graphgen, window="_blank"] - a tool that allows you to generate test data for your graph database. 


He’s since gone on to build the link:https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-php-client[Neo4j PHP driver, window="_blank"] and this week released a new version of link:https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-php-ogm[Neo4j PHP OGM, window="_blank"] - an object graph mapper for Neo4j.

He's also presented several talks at link:http://graphconnect.com/[GraphConnect, window="_blank"], Neo4j's bi-annual user conference, and the video of his talk 'Cypher: Write Fast and Furious' was published this week.

The coolest use of graphs this week goes to the link:https://elegans.herokuapp.com/[Worm Circuitry Explorer, window="_blank"] which link:https://elegans.herokuapp.com/about[stores the connectome (neuronal wiring diagram) of a worm in Neo4j, window="_blank"] and has an amazing d3.js interactive visualization. 


=== The bitcoin blockchain is a graph


We were lucky enough to have Greg Walker, the creator of link:http://learnmeabitcoin.com/[learnmeabitcoin, window="_blank"],  link:https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/237954465/[present at the London Neo4j meetup, window="_blank"] this week. Greg has stored the entire bitcoin blockchain in Neo4j and updates it every 10 minutes when new transactions are confirmed. 


The bitcoin graph contains over 1 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships. You can learn more from link:https://www.slideshare.net/neo4j/learnmeabitcoincom-the-bitcoin-blockchain-in-neo4j-by-greg-walker[Greg's slides, window="_target"].


link:https://twitter.com/straumat[Stéphane Traumat, window=”_blank”] link:https://github.com/straumat/blockchain2graph/releases[released version 0.4, window=”_blank”] of blockchain2graph - a tool that extracts information from the bitcoin blockchain and inserts them into Neo4j. 


This release contains performance improvements and now has relationships between previous and next block in the chain. 






=== Diving into UK corporation ownership with Neo4j


link:https://twitter.com/astroadamh[Adam Hill, window="_blank"] presented link:https://www.slideshare.net/AdamHill10/diving-into-uk-corporation-ownership-with-neo4j[Diving into UK corporation ownership with Neo4j, window="_blank"] at the Neo4j London meetup. In the talk Adam describes his participation in the link:http://www.datakind.org/projects/using-open-data-to-uncover-potential-corruption[DataKind Global Witness event, window="_blank"]  where the goal was to uncover potential corruption using open data. 


Adam and his team loaded the data into Neo4j and queried for tax havens, mega owners, and complicated corporate structures. The government is now investigating some of the companies and individuals identified as non compliant.


If you're interested in doing this type of data analysis and you'll be in London in May, join our link:https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/237040841/[data journalism focused GraphHack, window="_blank"] on 10th May. 


=== Real-time recommendations, GraphQL, discovering taxonomies


* link:https://twitter.com/gp_pulipaka[Dr. GP Pulipaka, window="_blank"] shared link:https://twitter.com/_nicolemargaret?lang=en[Nicole White, window="_blank"]’s Graph Connect Europe 2016 talk showing how to do link:https://neo4j.com/blog/real-time-recommendation-engine-data-science/[real time recommendations with Neo4j, window="_blank"]. 


* link:https://twitter.com/ryguyrg[Ryan Boyd, window="_target"] link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XbNhAJ9wh0[showed how he built, window="_blank"] the link:https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/[Neo4j sandbox, window="_blank"] using Docker, AWS Lambda, Auth0, and more  at the Neo4j online meetup. You can also link:https://www.slideshare.net/ryguyrg/building-the-neo4j-sandbox-aws-ecs-docker-python-neo4j[grab the slides, window="_blank"] from his talk.


* Magbic Aleman link:https://medium.com/@magbicaleman/go-graphql-and-neo4j-6d65b28736cd[got started with Neo4j last weekend, window="_blank"] and has now got a Go server up and running that serves Neo4j data via link:http://graphql.org/learn/[GraphQL, window="_blank"]. Maybe this is the weekend that you try Neo4j out for the first time?! 


* link:https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Jesús Barrasa, window="_blank"] shows how you can link:https://jesusbarrasa.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/quickgraph5-learning-a-taxonomy-from-your-tagged-data/[learn a taxonomy from tagged data, window="_blank"] using just a few Cypher queries. If you've got tagged data this technique is well worth a try for finding the latent structure between those tags.


=== Composite indexes, Javascript procedures, new GORM release


If you want to do something hands on with Neo4j this week there's lots of goodies to play with. 


* We released link:https://neo4j.com/release-notes/neo4j-3-2-0-alpha07/[Neo4j 3.2.0-alpha07, window="_target"] which contains composite indexes - a long requested feature. Give it a try and let us know how you get on.


* Michael Hunger created link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-script-procedures[neo4j-script-procedures, window="_blank"], a project that allows you to write Neo4j user-defined procedures in Javascript. He's also written link:http://jexp.de/blog/2017/04/fullstack-javascript-neo4j-script-procedures/[a blog post explaining how to use it, window="_blank"].


* link:https://twitter.com/graemerocher[Graeme Rocher,window="_blank"] released link:http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/neo4j/manual/index.html#releaseNotes[GORM 6.1, window="_blank"], a library that makes it easy to link:http://guides.grails.org/neo4j-movies/guide/index.html[integrate Neo4j in a Grails application, window="_blank"]. This release introduced support for the Neo4j Bolt Driver 1.2, allows batch inserts using FOREACH and UNWIND, supports path queries, and assigned identifiers


On my GitHub travels I also came across a couple of other interesting Neo4j based projects that have been recently updated.


* link:https://github.com/jri/deepamehta[deepamehta, window="_blank"] is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management that uses Neo4j under the covers and released 4.8.6 a few weeks ago.


* link:https://github.com/SciGraph/SciGraph[SciGraph, window="_blank"] is a Neo4j backed ontology store, that aims to represent ontologies and data described using ontologies as a graph.  You can learn more in this link:https://github.com/SciGraph/SciGraph/raw/master/docs/presentation/20150801%20SciGraph.pptx[overview slidedeck, window=”_blank”]

=== Tweets of the Week


I’m going to cheat this week and have two tweets of the week!


First up is a tweet by link:https://twitter.com/tastapod[Dan North, window="_blank"] in response to one by link:https://twitter.com/anildash[Anil Dash, window="_blank"] asking who’s doing the best job of developer relations in their respective communities.

If you’ve been around the Neo4j community for a little while you’ve probably had link:https://twitter.com/mesirii[@mesirii, window="_blank"] (aka Michael Hunger) reply to one of your questions on Slack or Stack Overflow at 3am, irrespective of the day of the week.


On behalf of the community, thanks for all your help Michael!


My other favourite tweet was by link:https://twitter.com/aaywee[Lauri Halkosaari, window="_blank"] who’s just started learning Neo4j and got up and running in 5 minutes.

That’s all for this week. We’ve posted on a Sunday this time due to the April Fool’s post that went out yesterday but we’ll be back next Saturday. 


Until then, have a great week!
