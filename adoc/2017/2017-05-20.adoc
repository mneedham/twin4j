* https://twitter.com/metadaddy[Pat Patterson^] wrote a cool post showing how to https://streamsets.com/blog/visualizing-analyzing-salesforce-data-neo4j/[analyse Salesforce data using Neo4j^]. Pat shows how to import data using the JDBC connector and then shows how to write a query to find the biggest outstanding opportunity.


* https://twitter.com/d_pawlukiewicz[Dariusz Pawlukiewicz^] has been writing a series of posts  on Neo4j and Cypher, and this week shows how to http://foreverframe.net/neo4j-cypher-2-creating-complex-query/[write complex queries^] as well as explaining the http://foreverframe.net/neo4j-cypher-3-union-with-clasuse/[UNION & WITH clauses^].

* On the https://techbrunch.gousto.co.uk/[Gousto Tech blog^] https://twitter.com/irenillap[Irene Iriarte^] explains how they've been https://techbrunch.gousto.co.uk/2017/05/18/decyphering-recipes/[combining graph databases and genetic algorithms^] to create an automated menu planning algorithm which produces new recipes for their customers.


* Quackit released a https://www.quackit.com/neo4j/tutorial/[tutorial for learning Neo4j^]. If you've been meaning to give Neo4j a try, this could be your weekend to get started!


=== State of graph databases survey


IBM released the results of their  http://www.zdnet.com/pictures/the-state-of-graph-databases-worldwide/[State of graph databases survey^] where people were asked why they're using graph databases and what they're planning to use them for in future.

=== Democratising data at Airbnb


Following on from their talk at GraphConnect Europe last week, Chris Williams and John Bodley explain how Airbnb have developed Dataportal, a novel data resource search and discovery tool
https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/democratizing-data-at-airbnb-852d76c51770[to make sense of their internal data^].

Dataportal combines Flask, ElasticSearch, and Neo4j to help employees discover and then search data that would usually only be available in team specific silos.
