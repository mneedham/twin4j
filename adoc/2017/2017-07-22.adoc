Leila is a long time member of the Neo4j community and pioneered the use of graphs and Neo4j for investigative journalism while working for the Guardian.


She's presented numerous Neo4j tutorials to data journalists, the https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fR0-s6XQ3SrJuHJdV-6ZgqqdsXUAqXz6FUeSupWiDNw/edit#slide=id.g1f55b63659_0_0[most recent^] being at The http://www.journalismfund.eu/dataharvest-conferences[European Investigative Journalism & Dataharvest Conference^] in Mechelen, Belgium.


Leila most recently participated in the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB1aVGXXCKs&index=34&list=PL9Hl4pk2FsvUq2Ae2_C2hZUs0pW4F6Bxj[Data Journalism in the Connected Age panel^] at GraphConnect Europe 2017.


On behalf of the data journalism and graph communities, thanks for all your work Leila!


=== The Graph of Thrones


In case you missed it, on Sunday the first episode of Game of Thrones Season 7 was released and we also launched our https://neo4j.com/blog/graph-of-thrones/[Game of Thrones Season 7 contest^].

If you create or publish graphy Game of Thrones content that uses Neo4j, graph visualizations, graph algorithms, combines datasets, or any other interesting variants, you’ll be eligible for our weekly GoT prize.


The prize is a Game of Thrones T-shirt of your choice plus EUR 50 worth of GoT paraphernalia (sorry, no swords), e.g., from https://www.elbenwald.de/Game-of-Thrones/[Elbenwald^] or similar outlets.


=== Getting started with Neo4j


https://twitter.com/GeekRuthie[Ruth Holloway^] has written the final two articles in her series on graph databases. She looks at https://opensource.com/article/17/7/neo4j-graph-databases-getting-started[how to install Neo4j and write some queries in the Neo4j browser^], and then how to https://opensource.com/article/17/7/neo4j-your-own-software-very-basic-perl-hacking[query the graph from a Perl application] using the http://search.cpan.org/~majensen/REST-Neo4p-0.2252/lib/REST/Neo4p.pm[Neo4p driver^].


If you're looking to getting started with Neo4j and Python, it's worth taking a look at https://twitter.com/_nicolemargaret[Nicole White^]'s http://nicolewhite.github.io/neo4j-flask/[microblog application powered by Flask and Neo4j tutorial^].


Nicole walks through the process of building a graph backed web application step by step implementing both read and write queries and finishes by deploying the application to Heroku.


=== Genetic programming, BIM models, DeepPhe NLP


* https://twitter.com/alisyria[Ali Ismail^], PhD Student & Research assistant-TU Dresden, shared the slides from his talk https://www.slideshare.net/AliIsmail7/convert-bim-ifc-models-into-graph-database-neo4j-based-on-ifcwebserverorg[Application of graph databases and graph theory concepts for advanced analysing of BIM (Building Information Modeling) models^].


* Daniel Escasa has been building a music database in Neo4j and has written a https://www.codementor.io/descasa/adventures-in-neo4j-a-music-database-9vx2nwyfs[3^] https://www.codementor.io/descasa/a-slight-change-from-the-previous-post-s-cypher-match-and-create-9z8q9h6v8[part^] https://www.codementor.io/descasa/my-neo4j-music-album-model-gets-kind-of-blue-9zcqw34ll#.WWx3MrKBqz4.twitter[series^] in which he evolves the model and learns more about different Cypher constructs.




* https://twitter.com/tbrantb[Brant Boehmann^], Sr. Software Engineer at https://twitter.com/ScrippsNet[Scripps Networks^], shared the slides from his http://conference.information-management.com/conferences/mdmsanfrancisco/[MDM & Data Governance San Francisco^] talk https://www.slideshare.net/BrantBoehmann/applying-graph-db-to-enterprise-mdm[Applying Graph DB to Enterprise MDM^]. MDM and data integration are popular use cases for graphs and Brant explains how the model simplicity/flexibility and query elegance have worked well for Scripps.


* https://twitter.com/NicMcPhee[Nic McPhee^] shared the code from his http://gecco-2017.sigevo.org/index.html/HomePage[GECCO (Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference) 2017^] tutorial on https://gist.github.com/NicMcPhee/9acc7e841130be22c6cc2254d8bf964e[Expressive genetic programming^]


* Simon Jupp shared the materials from his https://github.com/simonjupp/importing-lifesci-data-into-neo4j[Importing lifescience data into Neo4j^] session at the Graph Databases in Life and Health Sciences Workshop in June 2017.


* https://github.com/yuanzhou[Zhou (Joe) Yuan^] created https://github.com/DeepPhe/DeepPhe-Viz[DeepPhe-Viz^] which is used to visualise cancer patient summaries generated by the https://healthnlp.hms.harvard.edu/cancer/wiki/index.php/Main_Page[DeepPhe NLP tools^]. Neo4j is used to store the graph output of the tool.


=== An introduction to Neo4j Bolt Drivers


In this week’s online meetup https://twitter.com/technige[Nigel Small^] gave an introduction to Neo4j Bolt drivers which were first introduced in Neo4j 3.0.

We'll be running a https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/events/241874862/[Neo4j drivers roundtable online meetup^] on Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 15:00 UTC where a few driver authors from the community will join us to talk through their experiences.


=== From StackOverflow: Query Profiling, Optional Relationship Creation, Causal Clusters on EC2


We have a new section this week where we'll take a look at some of the most popular questions asked on https://stackoverflow.com/[StackOverflow^] with the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neo4j[#neo4j tag^].


* https://stackoverflow.com/users/7495230/afridi[Afridi^]'s question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45188231/cypher-neo4j-query-profiling[Cypher - Neo4j Query Profiling^] led to an interesting discussion about how the Cypher query planner works and how to interpret profile output.


* https://stackoverflow.com/users/3953904/abayob[Abayob^] asks how to do https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45152257/optional-merge-on-relationships[Optional merge on relationships^] - and is introduced to conditional execution via another variant of the http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2016/10/30/neo4j-create-dynamic-relationship-type/[FOREACH hack^]!


* https://stackoverflow.com/users/4264404/suryan[suryan^] had https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45160929/neo4j-causal-clustering-cant-form-with-ec2-instances[a problem spinning up a causal cluster on EC2^] which eventually turned out to be an issue with the advertised_address configuration.
