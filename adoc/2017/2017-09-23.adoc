I first came across Alessandro when he presented https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/4286-using-neo4j-and-reco4j-for-graph-based-recommendations[a talk on Reco4j^], a recommendation framework that combined Neo4j and Hadoop, in June 2013. 


He went on to create https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXyA9iZtro[Reco4^] before joining GraphAware. 


Alessandro is currently leading the charge on machine learning/graphs and presented https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8647-mining-and-searching-text-with-graph-databases[Mining and Searching text with Graph Databases^] at our most popular London meetup event to date. In the talk he showed how Neo4j and NLP can be combined to create advanced services on top of text analysis: recommendations, trend discovery, and finding influencers.


Alessandro will present http://sched.co/CGCQ[Powering Relevant Search with Neo4j and Elastic Search^] at GraphConnect New York on October 24th 2017. 


On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Alessandro!


=== From GraphConnect: RDF-vs-Property Graph Alternative Facts


We didn't have an online meetup this week so we'll recap one of my favourite talks from GraphConnect Europe 2017 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Mn178sEYg[Debunking some RDF-vs-Property Graph Alternative Facts^] - presented by my colleague https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Dr. Jesús Barrasa^]. 


youtube::t1Mn178sEYg[type={type}]


Jesus compares and contrasts the Labelled Property Graph (LPG) and RDF approaches to modelling graphs, the SPARQL and Cypher query languages, and addresses some common confusions when analysing these technologies. 


You can also see the online meetup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvwIqzaoYMo&list=PL9Hl4pk2FsvVnz4oi0F8UXiD3nMNqsRO2&index=23[Graph Databases, RDF, and linked data^] which covers similar ground.


=== Pentaho Kettle plugin, Native vs Non Native, Maven Dependency Graph


* https://twitter.com/know_bi[know.bi^]'s https://twitter.com/bartmaer[Bart Maertens^] announced the Pentaho Kettle plugin to https://www.know-bi.be/blog/article/easily-load-data-to-neo4j[load data into Neo4j^]


* https://twitter.com/jimwebber[Dr Jim Webber^] presented a webinar on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh4sppn8FSE[Native vs Non Native Graphs^] where he explains the benefits of being able to represent data as a graph all the way down the stack from the query language to on disk format.


* https://github.com/MZober1993[MZober1993^] created https://github.com/MZober1993/profiling-tools[profiling-tools^], a tool that exports your Maven dependency graph into Neo4j and then allows you to query for dependencies and sub modules.


=== On the podcast: Chuck Calio


This week on the Graphistania podcast http://blog.bruggen.com/2017/09/podcast-interview-with-chuck-calio-ibm.html[Rik interviews IBM's Chuck Calio^].

++++


Chuck and Rik discuss running https://neo4j.com/neo4j-on-ibm-power8/[Neo4j on IBM POWER8^] and the benefits you get from running large graphs on that type of hardware.


Chuck also shares his vision for where he thinks graphs will play a role in the future of technology. 


Chuck will be http://graphconnect.com/speaker/chuck-calio/[speaking at the GraphConnect New York conference^] on October 24th 2017.


=== Spring Data Neo4j, JVM Heap Analysis, New Lynda training course


* https://github.com/satishpeyyety[Satish Peyyety^] created https://github.com/satishpeyyety/retailstore-neo4j[retailstore-neo4j^], a set of RESTful services for an online retail store that runs on top of Neo4j using the https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-neo4j/[Spring Data Neo4j^] library.


* https://twitter.com/cleishm[Chris Leishman^] https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client/releases/tag/v2.2.0[released v2.2.0^] of https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client[neo4j-client^], a command line shell for Neo4j. This version adds support for rendering byte array outputs. 


* https://twitter.com/natpryce[Nat Pryce^] and https://twitter.com/richajam[James Richardson^]'s excellent 
https://speakerdeck.com/npryce/looking-for-smoking-guns-in-a-haystack-jvm-heap-analysis-with-neo4j[Looking for Smoking Guns in a Haystack: JVM Heap Analysis with Neo4J^] presentation from 2014 resurfaced. In this talk they show how to use Neo4j to track down a memory hogging JSON parser.


* My colleague https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] released a new Lynda training course https://www.lynda.com/Neo4j-tutorials/Database-Clinic-Neo4J/601789-2.html[Database Clinic: Neo4j^]. Will introduces the Cypher query language, shows how to model data sets in a graph, and how to query them using the Python driver.


=== On StackOverflow: Promise.all(), cartesian products, APOC


This week on https://stackoverflow.com/tags/neo4j/[Neo4j StackOverflow^]…​


* https://stackoverflow.com/users/6893866/tezra[Tezra^] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46283563/optimizing-a-cypher-query-to-improve-performance[performance tunes a graph global Cypher query^] by removing a cartesian product and brings down the execution time from 7700 seconds to 30 seconds.


* https://stackoverflow.com/users/6835358/bruno-peres[Bruno Peres^] suggests using the https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_apoc_periodic_commit[apoc.periodic.commit^] procedure to deal with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46277766/neo4j-long-lasting-query-to-be-split-executed-in-smaller-chunks[a slow running import query^].


* https://stackoverflow.com/users/266598/yalamber[Yalamber^] shows how to use JavaScript's https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all[Promise.all()^] to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46330060/how-to-use-promise-all-in-graphql-resolver-for-neo4j[collect the results of multiple Cypher queries in a GraphQL resolver^].
