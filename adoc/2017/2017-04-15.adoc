This week's featured community members, https://twitter.com/ashleycsun[Ashley Sun^] and https://twitter.com/rschoening[Rob Schoening^], are part of Lending Club's engineering team and been publishing several open-source tools for dev-ops to manage a vast variety of service and operations information.


They have https://neo4j.com/blog/managing-microservices-neo4j/[presented their early work at GraphConnect] and continue to evolve tools like https://github.com/LendingClub/macgyver[MacGyver], https://github.com/LendingClub/mercator[Mercator] and https://github.com/LendingClub/neorx[neorx, a reactive driver for Neo4j's http API].


link:https://twitter.com/ryguyrg[Ryan Boyd^] demoed an extension to Mercator in this week's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBFCb172vLU[webinar on IT-Operations] that tracks information from AWS ECS.

=== Star Wars Graph, Twitter clone, Reddit Place


* link:http://starwars.overstory.co.uk:5050/[Star Wars Graph^] is an interactive mashup of linked data sets created by the folks at link:http://www.overstory.co.uk/[overstory^].  They've imported data from the Star Wars API, combined it with social links derived from automated analysis of the Star Wars film scripts and additional information from The Movie DB API to create a combined, connected graph of Star Wars data.


* link:https://twitter.com/bod0ng[Bodong Chen^] link:http://bodong.ch/blog/2017/04/10/graphing-reddit-place.html[graphed the Reddit Place Sensation^]. link:https://www.reddit.com/r/place/[Reddit Place^] was an event run on April 1st where people had to collaborate to paint a virtual canvas. Bodong loaded a data dump of the event into Neo4j and showed how to analyse the behaviour of participants with a series of link:https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language/[Cypher^] queries.

* The video of link:https://twitter.com/jimwebber[Dr Jim Webber^]'s QCon London talk link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/causal-clustering-neo4j["Causal Consistency for Large Neo4j Clusters"^] is now available. In this talk Jim explains the Causal Clustering feature introduced in Neo4j 3.1

* link:https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^] adds the timeline feed and the ability to (un-)like posts to in his https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/04/10/building-a-twitter-clone-with-neo4j-part-five/[5th part of "Building a Twitter Clone with Neo4j"^]. He details the inner workings of each optimized feature discussing the complete implementation.

* For our German readers (or Google Translate users), Thomas Hensel from b-s-s dissects link:http://www.bigdata-unleashed.com/20170410/nat%C3%BCrliches-sprachverstehen-mit-neo4j[how to realize intent (action) and entity detection in natural language with a graph approach^]. By turning sentences into sequences of nodes and strengthening recurring patterns, training sets generate the intents implicitly.


* On our http://neo4j.com/developer/get-started[developer pages^], link:https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] finished a new guide on https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-create-neo4j-browser-guide/[creating custom Neo4j Browser Guides^], something many of you asked for. We'd love to get your feedback on this content and see your own creations shared on Twitter.



=== On GitHub

These are the interesting Neo4j based projects I found this week:


* link:https://github.com/i-am-tom[Tom Harding^] created link:http://npmdaily.com/pkg/neopreen[neopreen^] - a library of formatters and combinators to simplify working with data returned by the Neo4j driver.


* Robbie1977 created link:https://github.com/Robbie1977/docker-neo4j-knowledgebase[docker-neo4j-knowledgebase^] - a Neo4j Docker image containing the link:https://www.virtualflybrain.org/site/vfb_site/home.htm[VirtualFlyBrain.org KnowledgeBase^], a hub for neural anatomy and imaging data.


* link:https://github.com/RicardsGraudins[RicardsGraudins^] created link:https://github.com/RicardsGraudins/College-Timetable-Neo4j[College-Timetable-Neo4j^], which shows how to model a college timetable including rooms, departments, courses, and more.


=== From The Knowledge Base


This week from the  link:https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we'll look at some questions people have when importing CSV data into Neo4j.


* link:https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/How-do-I-define-a-LOAD-CSV-FIELDTERMINATOR-in-hexidecimal-notation/[How do I define a LOAD CSV FIELDTERMINATOR in hexidecimal notation^]


* link:https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/How-do-I-specify-the-field-and-array-delimiter-to-neo4j-import-as-a-ASCII-character/[How do I specify the field and array delimiter to neo4j-import as a ASCII character^]
