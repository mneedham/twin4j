This week Niklas released version 3.1 of Theo as well as a new release of https://github.com/niklassaers/Bolt-swift[Bolt-swift^] - an implementation of https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-3-0-milestone-1-release/[Neo4j's Bolt network protocol^] for the https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/[Swift^] programming language.


On behalf of the Neo4j and Swift communities, thanks for all your hard work Niklas!


=== WikiMap: Analysing Wikipedia in Neo4j


https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-shrimali/[Raj Shrimali^] has written a series of articles around importing Wikipedia into Neo4j. 

* https://medium.com/@scarca/wikimap-genesis-74e2a36d91d8[Genesis^] in which Raj explains the import process and loads in a subset of the full dataset.  
* https://medium.com/@scarca/wikimap-pivot-8888c28d1dbc[Pivot^] in which Raj experiments with using different number of threads to import the data.
* https://medium.com/@scarca/wikimap-optimization-7a979541ceb5[Optimization^] where the attempts to speed up the import process continue.
* https://medium.com/@scarca/wikimap-processing-2054a52a4aed[Processing^] where Raj runs a mini retrospective on the import process so far.


The code for Raj's project is available in the https://github.com/scarca/wiki-analysis[wiki-analysis^] repository on GitHub.


=== Neo4j <3 Preact


The https://neo4j.com/release-notes/neo4j-3-2-0/[release of Neo4j 3.2^] at GraphConnect Europe 2017 saw the release of a brand new version of the Neo4j browser.

The browser was completely rewritten using https://twitter.com/preactjs[Preact^], the fast 3kB alternative to the popular https://facebook.github.io/react/[React^] library, and Neo4j are now a proud sponsor of the project. 

On behalf of all users of the Neo4j browser, thank you Preact!


=== Getting started with Neo4j


This was a week where several people wrote about their experiences getting started with graph databases. 


* https://twitter.com/jim_d_hughes[James Hughes^] has just finished applying for the PMP exam and created the http://blog.jimdhughes.com/2017/05/25/my-dive-into-neo4j-and-my-pmp/[Project Management Body of Knowledge graph^]. James then analyzes the dataset using a series of Cypher queries.


* https://twitter.com/dianekierce[Diane Kierce^] is just getting into graph databases and has https://medium.com/@diane.kierce/graph-theory-and-graph-databases-a9c24ed53f65[written about her experience so far^]. 


* Paweł Głowacki has been going through the http://graphdatabases.com/[Graph Databases book^] and https://community.embarcadero.com/blogs/entry/graph-databases-and-neo4j[wrote a brief article^] containing his thoughts so far.


=== Friday is release day


This week saw the release of 4 different versions of Neo4j.

=== Python for IoT, PHP crawler, relational db analysis

* https://twitter.com/CarlTurechek[Carl Turechek^] created https://github.com/siteraiser/Reckless-Recluse[Reckless-Recluse^] - a powerful PHP crawler designed to dig up site problems.


* https://twitter.com/technige[Nigel Small^] created https://github.com/technige/n4[n4^] - a Cypher console for Neo4j. n4 aims to consolidate the old http://py2neo.org/v3/[py2neo^] command line tooling in a new console application which takes inspiration from https://twitter.com/_nicolemargaret[Nicole White^]'s https://github.com/nicolewhite/cycli[cycli^] tool.


* Matt Lewis created https://github.com/m4ttl/thingernet-graph[thingernet-graph^] - a Python script that creates a Neo4j graph showing how a set of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connected. 


* https://twitter.com/rubinsimons[Rubin Simons^] created https://github.com/rubin55/silver[silver^] - a tool for loading relational/dependency information from relational database systems into Neo4j for analysis and visualization. At the moment it works with Oracle and next up are PostgreSQL, MySQL, and DB2.


=== From The Knowledge Base


This week from the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we have an article showing how to https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/resetting-query-cardinality/[reset query cardinality in Cypher queries^] to address the 'too much WIP' issue that you can sometimes run into. 






=== On the Podcast: Steven Baker


On the Graphistania podcast this week we have an interview with https://twitter.com/srbaker[Steven Baker^], Neo4j Drivers Engineer and the creator of the Ruby behavior-driven development (BDD) framework http://rspec.info/[RSpec^]. 


https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik^] and Steven talk about the history of BDD, Steven's work building out drivers test infrastructure, living in Sweden, and more.
