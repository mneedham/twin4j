<strong>
Rare diseases research using graphs and Linkurious
</strong>
</p>
++++

* https://linkurio.us/[Linkuirous^] partner https://www.scibite.com/[SciBite^] explain how they've been able to use graphs to combine complex data from multiple sources to https://linkurio.us/blog/graph-technologies-help-rare-diseases-research/[help solve the challenges of rare diseases research^].


* https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^] is back with parts https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/05/02/building-a-twitter-clone-with-neo4j-part-seven/[seven^] and https://maxdemarzi.com/2017/05/03/building-a-twitter-clone-with-neo4j-part-eight/[eight^] of his building a Twitter clone series in which he builds a front end application to go with the back end system he's built over the last couple of months.


* Michael Morley shows how to use the spatial features in the https://www.menome.com/wp/using-neo4j-with-a-google-map/[APOC library to create a map view of  a Neo4j graph^]. 


=== Online Meetup: Planning your next hike with Neo4j

In this week's online meetup https://twitter.com/hoppyokapi[Amanda Schaffer^] showed us how to plan hikes using Neo4j.

There's lots of Cypher queries and a hiking recommendation engine, so if that's your thing give it a watch.


=== From The Knowledge Base


This week from the  link:https://neo4j.com/developer/kb[Neo4j Knowledge Base^] we've got an article showing how to https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/how-do-i-improve-the-performance-of-counting-number-of-relationships-on-a-node/[improve the performance of a query that counts the number of relationships on a node^].




=== On the podcast: Andrew Bowman


In his latest podcast interview Rik van Bruggen http://blog.bruggen.com/2017/05/podcast-interview-with-andrew-bowman.html[interviews our newest Neo4j employee, Andrew Bowman^]. You'll remember that Andrew was our very first featured community member on https://neo4j.com/blog/this-week-neo4j-25-february-2017/[25 February 2017^]. 


Rik and Andrew talk about Andrew's contributions to the community and Andrew's introduction to Neo4j while building social graphs for https://www.athenahealth.com/[Athena Health^].




=== On GitHub: Graph isomorphisms, visualization, natural language processing

There's a variety of different projects on my GitHub travels this week.


* Rui Jia created https://github.com/jiatistuta/subgraph-isomorphism-neo4j[subgraph-isomorphism-neo4j^], which given a query graph and a target graph will calculate all possible subgraphs of the target graph isomorphic to the query graph. 


* Julian Woodward created https://github.com/jhwoodward/visual-knowledge[visual-knowledge^], a visualization library  using http://visjs.org/[vis.js^]. Julian also has a http://52.56.227.23:50008/#/explore/Goya[cool demo of the library showing how artists are connected to each other^].

* https://twitter.com/hyperparticle[Dan Kondratyuk^] created https://github.com/Hyperparticle/graph-nlu[graph-nlu^] - a library which builds a graph based on the output Python's http://www.nltk.org/[NLTK^] library and then uses it to make predictions.


* https://twitter.com/funkatron[Ed Finkler^] created https://github.com/OSMIHelp/osmi-survey-graph[osmi-survey-graph^] - a project to import and analyse the https://osmihelp.org/research/[2016 OSMI Survey^] results in Neo4j. 


=== Next Week


It's http://graphconnect.com/[GraphConnect Europe 2017^] week so the European graph community will be at the https://qeiicentre.london/[QE2^] in London on Thursday 11th May 2017.

=== Tweet of the Week


I'm going to cheat again and have two favourite tweets of the week. 


First up is https://twitter.com/@cleishm[Chris Leishman^] sharing his favourite font for writing Cypher queries:
