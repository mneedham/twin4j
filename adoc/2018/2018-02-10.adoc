The https://neo4j.com/graphtour/[Neo4j GraphTour^] gets started next week with our first stops in Tel Aviv and Madrid. This is your chance to hear how Neo4j customers are using graphs and learn all about the Graph Platform.


We'll also be running GraphClinics at each event where you can come and ask Neo4j engineers for one-on-one help with your project and get all your graph related questions answered.


https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] or I will be at each event and will be presenting Utilizing Powerful Extensions for Analytics & Operations where we'll show how you how to supercharge your Neo4j experience.


There are still seats available for some of the events but don't procrastinate too long, https://neo4j.com/graphtour/[register now^]!


=== Featured Community Member: Tim Williamson


This week’s featured community member is https://twitter.com/timwilliate[Tim Williamson^], Data Scientist and Associate Fellow at Monsanto Company.

Tim has been a member of the Neo4j community for several years now and is a strong advocate for graphs on social media, frequently helping people out with their graph questions.


I first came across Tim during his presentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KEvLURBenM[Graphs Are Feeding The World^] at GraphConnect SF 2015, which he then followed up with a   https://neo4j.com/blog/tim-williamson-data-scientist-monsanto[5 minute interview^]. You can also https://speakerdeck.com/timwilliate/graphs-are-feeding-the-world[find the slides^] from Tim's talk.


Tim also presented https://speakerdeck.com/timwilliate/using-graph-databases-to-operationalize-insights-from-big-data[Using Graph Databases to Operationalize Insights from Big Data^] at Strata 2016 with Neo4j CEO https://twitter.com/emileifrem[Emil Eifrem^]. 


On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Tim!


=== Online Meetup: Data Science in Practice: Importing and Visualizing Facebook Using Graphs


In this week's online meetup Ray Barnard and Jen Webb from https://twitter.com/suprfanz[Suprfanz^] showed us how to import Facebook events into Neo4j and visualise them using d3.js.

They guided us through a Python based tutorial which you can find in the https://github.com/suprfanz/flask-fb-neo4j-d3[suprfanz/flask-fb-neo4j-d3^] GitHub repository.


=== Pick of the week: Reactome -  Efficient access to complex pathway data


A couple of weeks ago http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005968[the paper^] behind https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database[Reactome^] - a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways - was published.

<strong>
Reactome – Efficient access to complex pathway data
</strong>
</p>
++++


Reactome annotates processes in a consistent pathway model to create a resource for researchers as a core reusable pathway dataset for systems biology approaches. It also provides infrastructure and bioinformatics tools for search, visualisation, interpretation and analysis of pathways


In the paper the authors explain how they were able to use Neo4j and Cypher to greatly improve query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93% from when they stored the data in MySQL.


=== APOC, ETL Tool, Google Cloud Functions

* https://twitter.com/cskardon[Chris Skardon^] has started writing a http://xclave.co.uk/betterknowapoc/[Better Know APOC^] series of posts on the popular library. In the first post Chris shows http://xclave.co.uk/2018/02/02/better-know-apoc-0-introduction/[how to install APOC^] and explains the basic structure of all its procedures. He then has a post looking at the http://xclave.co.uk/2018/02/02/better-know-apoc-1-apoc-export-csv/[procedures available for exporting data from Neo4j^].


* https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] wrote https://medium.com/@david.allen_3172/capturing-and-integrating-service-data-with-google-cloud-functions-and-neo4j-588855f1695e[Capturing and Integrating Service Data with Google Cloud Functions and Neo4j]. He also shared the Google Cloud functions mentioned in the post in the https://github.com/moxious/neo4j-serverless-functions[neo4j-serverless-functions^] repository.


* https://twitter.com/praveenasekhar[Praveena Fernandes^] presented a webinar - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxFIvEjBT98[Interpreting Relational Schema to Graphs^] -  in which she showed how to use the https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-etl/#_neo4j_desktop[ETL Tool from the Neo4j Desktop^].  You can also https://www.slideshare.net/neo4j/interpreting-relational-schema-to-graphs[view Praveena's slides^].


* A question on StackOverflow about https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48651073/is-there-a-need-to-create-bi-directional-relationship-in-neo4j-graph[bidirectional relationships^] led me to rediscover https://graphaware.com/neo4j/2013/10/11/neo4j-bidirectional-relationships.html[a timeless article^] written by https://twitter.com/bachmanm[Michal Bachman^] back in 2013 where he covers this topic in detail.


=== On the Podcast: Laura Drummer

This week on the podcast https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik^] http://blog.bruggen.com/2018/02/podcast-interview-with-laura-drummer.html[interviewed^] https://twitter.com/LawsyZ[Laura Drummer^], Director of Software & Engineering at Novetta Solutions.  


They talk about Laura's work building social networks of not only people, but also things that they're talking about. Laura explains how she's been able to use Python Data Science tools http://scikit-learn.org/[scikit-learn^] and https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/[gensim^] to build these graphs.


Laura presented the talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5PBXX1CZQs[Sentiment and Social Network Analysis^] at GraphConnect NYC 2017 so I'd recommend watching that if you want to learn more.
