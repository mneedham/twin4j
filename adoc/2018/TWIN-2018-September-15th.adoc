=== Featured Community Member: Scott Sosna

This week’s featured community member is https://twitter.com/scott_sosna[Scott Sosna^], Software Senior Principal Engineer at Dell EMC.

featured::https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20180914020354/this-week-in-neo4j-15-september-2018.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80114[name="Scott Sosna"]

Scott has been using Neo4j to explore different open data sets, and has already presented his work at the https://www.slideshare.net/ScottSosna/visualizing-open-data-using-neo4j-full?qid=7dea949f-d21f-44f8-9e2f-53cfb30bb587&v=&b=&from_search=1[Central Iowa Java Users Group^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5emCx1D_Qoc[DevoxxUK^], and most recently at the https://www.slideshare.net/ScottSosna/dubjug-neo4j-and-open-data-114125167[DubJUG^]. 

Scott explores how to use Neo4j for traffic data, the London tube network, US government public disclosure filings, and more! You can find some of Scott's other graph datasets on https://github.com/scsosna99?tab=repositories[GitHub^].

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Scott!

=== Neo4j Bloom Data Visualization for Everyone

This week https://twitter.com/jeffmmorris[Jeff Morris^] presented a webinar about Neo4j Bloom, a data visualization tool on the Neo4j Graph Platform.

youtube::fIjQ1__Z2Ww[type={type}]

Jeff explains why graph visualization is such an important tool for business users and then describes the features that Neo4j Bloom has to offer, such as near natural language search, code free graph changes, and direct graph interactions. Finally he shows how to use Bloom on several different datasets.

If you're attending https://graphconnect.com/[GraphConnect NYC 2018^] next week (20/21 September), you'll be able to learn more about Bloom in the following sessions:

++++

https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^] has written a blog post explaining how to use the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/page-rank/#_personalized_pagerank[Personalized PageRank^] algorithm that was added in the https://medium.com/neo4j/graph-algorithms-release-random-walk-and-personalized-pagerank-80160db3757[most recent release of the Graph Algorithms library^].

In the post Tomaz goes through a worked example showing how to build an article recommender system that finds the best articles or papers for a keyword given the context of the researcher asking the question. 

As well as using the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/[Graph Algorithms library^], Tomaz also uses https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-nlp[GraphAware NLP^] to build a graph of key phrases in each paper.

=== Solving the bucket-filling problem with Neo4j

https://twitter.com/mambofish[Vince Bickers^] explains how to solve the bucket-filling problem by creating a state machine where each state is a node, and transitions between states are relationships.

Vince shows how to build out the state machine using various Cypher queries, ensuring that none of the rules of the game are broken as we do this. He then shows how to find all possible solutions for the problem using Cypher's shortest path algorithm.

=== How Graphs Revolutionize Identity and Access Management

https://twitter.com/ellazal[Lju Lazaravic^] presented a webinar in which she explained why Neo4j is such a great fit for Identity and Access Management.

youtube::Mk1QYLOeq3s[type={type}]

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
