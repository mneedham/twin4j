This Week in Neo4j – Building a dating website, 

[Body copy:]
////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we have the NetSCAN community detection algorithm, Neo4j to Contentful in Elixir, messaging features are added to the dating site, and we learn how to build trending activity feeds Using GraphQL and Neo4j. 

I also want to give a special shout out to long time Neo4j community member https://community.neo4j.com/t/christophe-willemsen/171[Christophe Willemsen^], who this week was promoted to Chief Technology Officer at our partner GraphAware. Congratulations Christophe!

=== Featured Community Member: Maxim Salnikov

This week’s featured community member is https://twitter.com/webmaxru?lang=en[Maxim Salnikov^], Full-Stack Engineer at ForgeRock.

featured::https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20180831023213/this-week-in-neo4j-1-september-2018.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80114[name="Maxim Salnikov"]

Maxim has been using Neo4j as part of some experiments building a relationship-based digital identity platform. 

He is a https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmXhAjRjRcwKLhoDrGEeI-t67Wg6_0eD8[prolific speaker^] on front-end web platforms, and has created two tools to make it easier for front-end developers to build Neo4j applications:

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-neo4j[angular-neo4j^] is a module that makes it easy to use the Neo4j Bolt driver for JavaScript from an Angular application.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-neo4j-bolt[node-red-contrib-neo4j-bolt^] is a Node-RED node with shareable server configuration that lets you run generic Cypher queries against a Neo4j server.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Maxim!

=== Building Trending Activity Feeds Using GraphQL And Neo4j

Last week we launched our new https://community.neo4j.com/[Neo4j forum^], and you may have noticed that at the top of the home page there are links to content created by members of the community. 

image::https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20180831010413/2018-08-31_09-02-59.png[]

My colleague https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] has written a blog post explaining how we built it using Neo4j, GraphQL (via the https://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^]), the https://docs.discourse.org/[Discourse API^], and the https://github.com/community-graph[community graph^].

The community generates more content than we could fit on the page, so Will goes into detail about a Cypher query he wrote that implements an exponential time decay function (similar to that used by Hacker News and Reddit) to work out which content to surface. 

If you have a blog post or article that you'd like to see appear at the top of the home page don't forget to post it in the https://community.neo4j.com/c/community-content-blogs[Community Content & Blogs^] forum.

* https://twitter.com/vitorcautiero[Vitor Horta^] https://medium.com/neo4j/community-detection-in-social-networks-with-neo4j-and-netscan-d2f90074dcbb[wrote a blog post^] explaining the NetSCAN algorithm that he developed to detect communities in social networks and find influential people. The algorithm is available as a Neo4j procedure and can be called directly from Cypher.

* https://twitter.com/chriseyre2000[Chris Eyre^] has ported his https://github.com/chriseyre2000/contentful_to_neo4j_ex[Neo4j to Contentful library^] from Node to Elixir, and https://devrantsblog.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/contentful-to-neo4j-in-elixir/[explains some of the challenges^] he encountered while doing this. Chris will be giving a talk and workshop about the library on https://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/253788396/[5th September 2018^] at the Neo4j London meetup.

* José RF Junior has https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/certificação-neo4j-josé-r-f-junior/[written a blog post^] (it's in Portuguese, but thank you Google Translate!), in which he shares his tips and tricks for taking and passing the https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/neo4j-certification/[Neo4j Certification exam^].

* Vaibhav Shah has written a step by step guide explaining https://www.codementor.io/vaibhavshah/installing-neo4j-on-ubuntu-14-04-step-by-step-guide-mvgkn0o29[how to install Neo4j on Ubuntu 14.04^].

This week https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^] added another three posts to his https://maxdemarzi.com/tag/dating/[Build a Dating site^] series. 

In https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/08/27/building-a-dating-site-with-neo4j-part-ten/[Part 10^] Max adds messaging functionality and walks through different modeling choices that we could make when building such a feature into a graph model.

In https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/08/28/building-a-dating-site-with-neo4j-part-eleven/[Part 11^] he implements the read side of this feature. Users now have a directory of all the conversations that they've been part of.

In https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/08/29/building-a-dating-site-with-neo4j-part-twelve/[Part 12^] we learn how to add images to those messages.

[[online-meetup]]
=== How Graphs Revolutionize Identity and Access Management

https://twitter.com/ellazal[Lju Lazaravic^] presented a webinar in which she explained why Neo4j is such a great fit for Identity and Access Management.

youtube::Mk1QYLOeq3s[type={type}]

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
