Welcome to This Week in Neo4j where I share the most interesting things I found in our community over the last seven days.

This week Craig Taverner did a great talk about Neo4j Spatial, Jennifer Reif showed how to import data from the Marvel API into Neo4j, David Fox's presentation about moving an activity feed from Cassandra to Neo4j was published, and more!

=== Online Meetup: All About Neo4j Spatial

In last week's online meetup, https://twitter.com/craigtaverner[Craig Taverner^] taught us how to build spatial backed applications using Neo4 3.4.

All the resources mentioned during the talk are listed on the https://community.neo4j.com/t/online-meetup-neo4j-spatial-dec-6/3443/2[Neo4j community forum^], where you can also go to ask Craig any questions about the talk.

News last week that the headquarters of Deutsche Bank was raided in a money laundering investigation as a result of the Panama Papers investigation led Will Lyon to write a post showing how to explore the ICIJ's Panama Papers data in the context of this investigation.

Will shows how to use Neo4j Bloom to explore the data around Deutsche Bank, and then shows how to write Cypher queries to look into subsidiaries that were allegedly involved in the money laundering scheme at the center of the most recent investigations.

In the second post in https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] series of posts showing how to build a full stack application with Spring and Neo4j,  Jennifer explains how to get the data out of Marvel's API and into Neo4j.

Jennifer comes up with an innovative way to get as much data as possible within the rate limits of the API, and then shows how to use the APOC library's Load JSON and periodic iterate procedures to import the data into Neo4j.

Matt Casters has written a blog post explaining how to get up and running with the Kettle data ingestion tool. 

Matt explains all the steps required, from downloading Pentaho, to setting up the Neo4j plugins, and launching Spoon, the imaginatively named Kettle GUI.

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
