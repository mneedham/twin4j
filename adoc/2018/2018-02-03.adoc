This Week in Neo4j – 3 June 2017


[Body copy:]
////


Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days. 


This week we have a graph of Thomson Reuters’ OpenPermID dataset, running Neo4j on Google Cloud, migrating from MySQL to Neo4, as well as a data lineage talk from GraphConnect NYC 2017.

Suellen has been part of the Neo4j community for several years and presented her work using graphs to analyse digital humanities data at https://neo4j.com/blog/suellen-stringer-hye-vanderbilt-university/[GraphConnect San Francisco 2015^]. She also presented https://github.com/HeardLibrary/graphs-without-ontologies[Using Neo4j to Explore Nascent Research Networks^] with https://twitter.com/andersoncliffb[Clifford Anderson^] and https://twitter.com/mrwargames[Ed Warga^] at the http://vivoconference.org/[2015 VIVO Conference^].

Suellen was also https://soundcloud.com/leadinglines/episode-006-suellen-stringer-hye-and-micheal-hunger[interviewed on the Leading Lines podcast^] alongside my colleague https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] in 2016.


On behalf of the Neo4j and humanities communities, thanks for all your work Suellen!


=== Pick of the week: Thomson Reuters’ OpenPermID Graph


In the latest installation of his https://jesusbarrasa.wordpress.com/tag/rdf/[Neo4j is your RDF store^] series https://twitter.com/barrasadv[Jesús Barrasa^] https://jesusbarrasa.wordpress.com/2018/02/01/neo4j-is-your-rdf-store-part-3-thomson-reuters-openpermid/[shows how to build a graph^] of https://permid.org/[Thomson Reuters OpenPermId dataset^].

Thomson Reuters’ OpenPermID
</strong>
</p>

In the first part of the post Jesus shows how to import the dataset using the https://github.com/jbarrasa/neosemantics[neosemantics^] extension. The dataset contains 127 million triples which is turned into a graph of 18.8 million nodes and 101 million relationships. 


Jesus then goes on to show how to query the graph to do complex path analysis and how to build nice charts on the output of those queries using standard BI tools. He finishes the post by showing how to build an RDF API on top of the graph.


You can get all the code from Jesus' blog post from the https://github.com/jbarrasa/openpermid2neo4j[openpermid2neo4j^] GitHub repository.

=== From GraphConnect: Real-Time Data Lineage at UBS


At GraphConnect NYC 2017 Wren Chan and Sidharth Goyal explained how Neo4j allows them to trace lineage of all metrics for all initiatives across the bank.

Their solution is the combination of real time response time and agility.


=== Kubernetes on Google Cloud, Django, Excel
