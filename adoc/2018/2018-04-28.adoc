Fabio has a background in transportation networks, urban mobility and data analysis and I first came across him from https://www.behance.net/gallery/55657171/Open-Data-per-la-Cultura-2017[his work analysing migration patterns^] in 2017.


Fabio presented at the Data Science Milan meetup last September, where he showed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl5uSzyNsXI[how to combine Neo4j and Python (Italian)^] and last week presented https://speakerdeck.com/fblamanna/discovering-the-power-of-graph-databases-with-python-and-neo4j[Discovering the Power of Graph Databases with Python and Neo4j^] at  https://www.pycon.it/en/[PyCon Italia^].


On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Fabio!

*  https://twitter.com/michellesanver[Michelle Sanver^] has written a blog post titled https://www.liip.ch/en/blog/neo4j-and-graphql-a-perfect-match[Neo4j graph database and GraphQL: A perfect match^], in which she shows how to install and use the GraphQL plugin to execute GraphQL queries against Neo4j. 


* My colleague https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] shares some https://medium.com/neo4j/neo4j-certification-how-to-pass-like-a-pro-eed6daa7c6f7[tips and tricks on studying for and passing the Neo4j Certification^].


* In https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^]'s latest blog post he shows how to https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/neo4j-a-algorithm/[combine Neo4j APOC spatial functions with the Neo4j Graph Algorithms A* Algorithm^] to help plan your next trip around Europe.

* David Mack has written a new installment in his series of posts on graph based machine learning. This time he https://medium.com/octavian-ai/review-prediction-with-neo4j-and-tensorflow-1cd33996632a[creates an embedding to predict product reviews using Neo4j and Tensorflow^]. 


* https://twitter.com/Emehrkay[Mark Henderson^] released version 0.7 of https://github.com/emehrkay/Pypher[Pypher^], a small library that aims to make it easier to use Neo4j from Python by constructing Cypher queries from pure Python objects. This version includes property map, map, and map projection support, as well as a simple CLI app that allows you test your Pypher scripts in real time.


* https://github.com/sandman0[sandman0^] released https://github.com/nullibrew/node-red-contrib-nulli-neo4j[node-red-contrib-nulli-neo4j^], a https://nodered.org/[Node-RED^] node that lets you run generic cypher queries on a Neo4j graph database. Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together Internet of Things devices in new and interesting ways.
