This Week in Neo4j – Building a dating website, 

[Body copy:]
////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week Max De Marzi shows us how to build a dating website using Neo4j, Adam Cowley analyses Google Analytics in Neo4j, we learn how to manipulate data structures using APOC, and we find the shortest path from Århus to Rome.

Andrea has been part of the Neo4j community for several years, and in 2016 he https://medium.com/apache-zeppelin-stories/experimenting-with-neo4j-and-apache-zeppelin-d80b7bec8fd2[started experimenting^] with Neo4j support for https://zeppelin.apache.org/[Apache Zeppelin notebooks^].

Andrea built the Zeppelin Interpreter that connects to Neo4j and allows users to query and display the graph data directly in the notebook (both in graph and tabular formats). The interpreter was released last week as part of the https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0/interpreter/neo4j.html[0.8 release^].  

Andrea has written a blog post explaining how to https://medium.com/@andreasanturbano/building-a-graph-data-pipeline-with-zeppelin-spark-and-neo4j-8b6b83f4fb70[build a graph data pipeline^] using the two tools. He also added https://neo4j.com/blog/latest-release-apoc-library-march-2018/[HDFS support to the popular APOC library^].

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Andrea!

=== Building a dating website with Neo4j

https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^] has written a series of blog posts explaining how to build your own dating website using Neo4j.

Max starts by introducing the graph model before showing how to build a backend API and frontend for user registration and sign-in. You can read all the posts below:

[[apoc-series]]
=== Creating and manipulating data structures with APOC 

While Cypher can create and use literal maps/documents, APOC takes it to the next level by adding functions to create and update them dynamically and also convert or extract data from maps.

In the latest video of the APOC series https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how to use these functions to turbo charge your graph applications.

*  https://twitter.com/lassewesth[Lasse Westh-Nielsen^] has https://lassewesth.blogspot.com/2018/07/the-international-e-road-network-and.html[written a blog post^] in which he shows how to load European road data into Neo4j and then run path finding queries on the resulting graph. He starts with basic pattern matching, before showing the different routes that the weighted and unweighted shortest path algorithms come up with when going between Århus and Rome.

* In https://twitter.com/adamcowley?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor[Adam Cowley^]'s latest blog post he explores https://www.adamcowley.co.uk/neo4j/importing-google-analytics-to-neo4j-via-bigquery-using-apoc-jdbc/[loading Google Analytics data into Neo4j^] via BigQuery automated periodic imports. Adam shows how to use APOC's Load JDBC procedure to load data into Neo4j and then writes some queries to determine the different paths users take during their time on a website.

* Divya Jyoti Rajdev has written an article https://community.tibco.com/wiki/spotfire-tips-tricks-access-visualize-graph-data-neo4j-spotfire[showing how to connect, access, and display data from Neo4j in TIBCO Spotfire^], a data visualization and analytics product.

Last week https://twitter.com/ML_auren[Lauren^] wrote an article explaining the linear regression procedures she added for Neo4j, and this week she's https://medium.com/neo4j/a-developers-look-ml-models-in-neo4j-7d4cbacb320c[written an article^] explaining some of the internals.

Lauren explains her design decisions and looks at the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Lauren and https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] also have https://twitter.com/ML_auren/status/1017522612316983296[an interesting discussion on twitter^] about using Neo4j as a master data solution for machine learning systems.

* Cytoscape is an open source software platform for visualizing complex networks and integrating these with any type of attribute data. This week there was a new release 0.3 of the https://github.com/corwur/cytoscapeneo4j[Neo4j plugin^] for http://www.cytoscape.org/[Cytoscape^] 3.6. This version of the plugin has enhanced import/export options and allows users to expand nodes or network using different methods, as well as find the  shortest path between selected nodes.  You can http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cytoscapeneo4jplugin[download the plugin^] from the Cytoscape app store.

* In this week's https://dzone.com/articles/machine-learning-on-graphs-5-minute-interview-with[5 minute interview^] Ajinkya Kale, Senior Applied Researcher at eBay's New Product Development Group, tells us how he got started with Neo4j and about his vision for machine learning on knowledge graphs.
