Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we have releases of APOC and the Neo4j JDBC Driver, a paper explaining how to derive socially useful information from public blockchains, a refresh of the Neo4j ETL guide, and more!

=== Featured Community Member: Michael Graham

This week’s featured community member is https://twitter.com/michaeldgrahams[Michael Graham^], Full Stack Developer.

Michael Graham has recently been exploring using Neo4j with GraphQL. He's the author of the the https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-binding[neo4j-graphql-bindings^] and https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-server[neo4j-graphql-server^] npm packages,  which make it easier to build GraphQL APIs using the neo4j-graphql database plugin. 
He previously worked as a developer at University of California - Riverside working on online tools for teaching symbolic logic.

Most recently Michael has been working with my colleague Will Lyon on https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-js[neo4j-graphql-js^], a GraphQL to Cypher query execution layer for Neo4j and JavaScript GraphQL implementations.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Michael!

=== How Graphs Revolutionize Identity and Access Management

https://twitter.com/ellazal[Lju Lazaravic^] presented a webinar in which she explained why Neo4j is such a great fit for Identity and Access Management.

youtube::Mk1QYLOeq3s[type={type}]

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

* In https://medium.com/@jennifer.reif/how-do-you-know-if-a-graph-database-solves-the-problem-a7da10393f5[How Do You Know If a Graph Database Solves the Problem?^], https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] describes different use cases where a graph database may or may not make sense. If you're wondering whether to use Neo4j for your next project, this post will help you make your decision.

* Jennifer has also done a complete refresh of the https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-etl/[Neo4j ETL guide^]. In this guide Jennifer explains how to get up and running with the Neo4j ETL Tool, and then takes us through a guided tour of the tool while importing data from a Postgres database.

* https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] wrote a blog post in which he https://medium.com/neo4j/visualizing-graphs-in-3d-with-webgl-9adaaff6fe43[shows how to visualize graphs in 3D with WebGL^] using the https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph[3d-force-graph library^].

There were lots of releases this week!

First up was Tom Sawyer Perspectives which https://www.tomsawyer.com/pressreleases/exciting-model-based-engineering-enhancements-and-save-to-neo4j-now-available[released version 8.2^]. This release contains  Model-Based Engineering enhancements and the ability to save to Neo4j. 

Neo4j JDBC Driver https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc/releases/tag/3.4.0[version 3.4.0 was released^]. This version contains support for the spatial and temporal data types introduced in Neo4j 3.4. It also has full clustering and routing support.


And finally, we had the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/tag/3.4.0.2[summer release of APOC^].  This version added support for reverse geocoding in apoc.spatial, base 64 URL  encoding and decoding, new apoc.diff user functions, and much more

* https://twitter.com/dan_mcginn[Dan McGinn^] has published a paper titled http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/5/8/180298.full.pdf[Towards open data
blockchain analytics: a Bitcoin perspective^] in which he describes how to use Neo4j to derive socially useful information from public blockchains. 

* https://twitter.com/vizdatamodeler?lang=en[Thomas Frisendal^] shows how to build a graph data model directly from meta data stored in XML files in his latest blog post titled http://www.dataversity.net/emergence-metadata-science-using-graph-technology-data-modeling/[The Emergence of ”Metadata Science”? Using Graph Technology for Data Modeling^]


* https://doi.org/10.1515/jib-2018-0023[Towards FAIRer Biological Knowledge Networks Using a Hybrid Linked Data and Graph Database Approach^], a paper written by https://twitter.com/mbrandizi[Marco Brandizi^], https://twitter.com/i_am_Ajit[Ajit Pratap Singh^], https://twitter.com/ChrisRawlings[Chris Rawlings^], and https://twitter.com/KeywanHP[Keywan Hassani-Pak^]  has been published.  The authors have developed a simple application ontology based on OWL/RDF with mappings to standard schemas. They show how to use this ontology to power data access services like resolvable URIs, SPARQL endpoints, JSON-LD web APIs and Neo4j-based knowledge graphs.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.

Last week https://twitter.com/ML_auren[Lauren^] wrote an article explaining the linear regression procedures she added for Neo4j, and this week she's https://medium.com/neo4j/a-developers-look-ml-models-in-neo4j-7d4cbacb320c[written an article^] explaining some of the internals.

Lauren explains her design decisions and looks at the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Lauren and https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] also have https://twitter.com/ML_auren/status/1017522612316983296[an interesting discussion on twitter^] about using Neo4j as a master data solution for machine learning systems.
