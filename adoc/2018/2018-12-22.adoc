In the week of the longest night, Mark is enjoying a well earned vacation, so I can use the opportunity to thank him for his relentless work reading through all the amazing things that happen in our Neo4j community every week to present them to you in a compact format. 

This week is no exception and it was way too much to give everything enough credit. So enjoy this last 2018 edition of this week in Neo4j. We're back in January, until then enjoy your Holidays and have a Happy New Year.

=== Featured Community Member: Raik Lochau

This weeks featured community member is Raik Lochau, also known as ThirstForKnowledge on StackOverflow. Raik lives in Brühl, Germany, which you might know for its PhantasiaLand theme park (also the venue for JavaLand).

Raik recently left a position as an IT manager of large corporate projects in enterprise environments to found a fashion startup with his wife.

To realize his passion he was looking for a better data model to handle the different aspects of such an application (master data management, recommendations, price management, customer preferences, social, predictive analytics and more) and came across Neo4j. 
He uses Spring Data Neo4j for the backend implementation, and is looking forward to explore all possibilities of the library and provide feedback to the (also German) SDN team which lives close by.

Since starting the effort, Raik has been very active on StackOverflow answering 41 Neo4j-related questions in the last few months, which is really impressive. 
Especially the depth and care of his answers is remarkable.

In the name of the Neo4j Community, thanks a lot for all your work Raik, and we're looking forward to seeing more answers from you and perhaps even articles and talks on Neo4j related topics (e.g at Java User Groups in your region).

Thomas Silkjær published the second part of his XRP (Ripple) analysis series with Neo4j.
Here he demonstrates the data ingestion (45M nodes, 89M relationships) and the initial exploration of the data with some really interesting queries.

Looking forward to the hosted version of this dataset, with a full Neo4j Browser guide. Stay tuned.

Michael Simons contributed Neo4j support to https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/releases/tag/1.10.3[testcontainers].
Thanks so much for that!
Now you can spin up Neo4j test instances for your JVM projects, find https://www.testcontainers.org/usage/neo4j_container.html[more in the docs here].

Michael started to apply it to Spring Data Neo4j and we plan the same for APOC and other libraries.

Also this week, František Hartman from our partner GraphAware published an article "Integration testing with Docker Neo4j image and Testcontainers" by using a Generic Container.
Some of the feature are now built in, others like custom extensions are still relevant.

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
