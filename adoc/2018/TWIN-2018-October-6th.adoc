Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we learn how to supercharge developer productivity with the latest release of neo4j-graphql.js, there's a new release of the Kettle plugins for Neo4j, we have a GraphConnect experience report, and blog posts showing how to use the new Jaccard and Cosine Similarity algorithms.

Ralf has been a member of the Neo4j community for more than 6 years and has built integrations with the https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-tableau-integration/[Tableau^] and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2OgSVlPpiA[QlikView^] business intelligence products, as well as presenting at many meetups on this subject.

Ralf was also http://blog.bruggen.com/2015/04/podcast-interview-with-ralf-becher-tiq.html[interviewed on the Graphistania podcast^] in April 2015, where he explained how the combination of graphs and BI tools can help us gain even more insight into our data.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Ralf!

https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] announced a new version of neo4j-graphql.js, which now makes it possible to spin up a GraphQL API backed by a graph database with just type definitions. 

The 1.0.1 release has several new features to help *supercharge your developer productivity*. These include:

* Auto-generate Query/Mutation types and resolvers
* Augment a GraphQL schema with pagination, ordering, and _id fields
* Flexible handling of relationship types, including relationship properties
* Middleware support can be used to implement authentication/authorization with generated resolvers

If you haven't tried out GraphQL with Neo4j, now is the time!

=== Creating a Neo4j Sandbox

My colleague https://community.neo4j.com/u/elaine.rosenberg[Elaine Rosenberg^] has created a video that shows how to get up and running with the https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/[Neo4j Sandbox^].

youtube::rmfgRKPjhl8[type={type}]

The Neo4j Sandbox creates a temporary Neo4j instance in the cloud for learning about Neo4j graphs. We have several sandboxes with built in datasets such as the Panama Papers and Russian Twitter Trolls, but you can also create a blank sandbox if you just want to play with Neo4j and aren't able to install the Neo4j Desktop.

This week Rik interviewed https://twitter.com/mckenzma[Michael McKenzie^] on the Graphistania podcast. Michael was our https://neo4j.com/blog/this-week-in-neo4j-exploring-large-knowledge-graphs-analysing-youtube-videos-using-nlp-techniques-data-modelling-for-beginners/[featured community member of the week for 4th August 2018^].

Michael explains how he first became interested in graphs while trying to work out how building codes and texts were interrelated - an information graph being the solution to this problem. 

Michael goes on to explain his experience working with the Cypher query language and his use of the https://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^] on some personal passion projects.

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
