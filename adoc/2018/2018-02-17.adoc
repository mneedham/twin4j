Gábor has been part of the Neo4j community for several years and  is currently working on a PhD which contains several graph related topics. He's researching how to incrementally query graphs and benchmark such an incremental graph query engine as well as analysing multiplex networks. He http://blog.bruggen.com/2017/02/podcast-interview-with-gabor-szarnyas.html[featured on the Graphistania podcast in February 2017^] where he explained this in more detail.


Gábor is an active participant in the openCypher community and presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLu2w8JxMKo[ingraph: Live Queries on Graphs^] at GraphConnect Europe 2017. You can also find the https://www.slideshare.net/neo4j/graphconnect-europe-2017-ingraph-live-queries-on-graphs[slides^] from the talk. More recently Gábor showed how to https://www.slideshare.net/szarnyasg/compiling-opencypher-graph-queries-with-spark-catalyst[compile openCypher graph queries with Spark Catalyst^] and presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYBURFmH9Xk[graph-based source code analysis^] at FOSDEM 2018.


On behalf of the openCypher and Neo4j communities, thanks for all your work Gábor!

This week NBC News https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731[publicly released a database of deleted Tweets from their investigation into how Russian Twitter Trolls^] may have influenced the 2016 US election.


They've also written https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/russian-trolls-pushed-graphic-racist-tweets-american-voters-n823001[a couple^] https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/russian-trolls-went-attack-during-key-election-moments-n827176[of posts^] where they analyse the data.


https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] has written a post showing how to https://hackernoon.com/six-ways-to-explore-the-russian-twitter-trolls-database-in-neo4j-6e52394c38f1[explore The Russian Twitter Trolls Database In Neo4j^] including a new Neo4j sandbox prepopulated with the dataset. You can get up and running with that in just a couple of minutes at http://www.neo4j.com/sandbox[neo4j.com/sandbox^]. 


=== 7,000 Slack Users!


This week we had our 7,000th member of the community registered on the Neo4j-Users Slack, getting questions answered and helping others with their Neo4j journey.

<strong>
7,000 Users on Neo4j Slack
</strong>
</p>
++++


Since 2015 there have been just under 400,000 messages posted and around 500 active users per day. This is still the best place to get help with your Cypher query, Cluster configuration, or data import questions.


Thank you to everybody who's helped others get up to speed with graphs and if you haven't already joined, what are you waiting for?!
