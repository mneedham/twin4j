Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we have DeepGL on Peer to Peer Network, Relational to Graph with APOC, Global Power Emissions Database, Graphs and AI, Agent Smith: A “top” application for Neo4j, and more!

=== Featured Community Member: Devansh Trivedi

This weeks featured community member is https://twitter.com/devanshRtrivedi?lang=en-gb[Devansh Trivedi^], Data Scientist and Research Fellow.

featured::https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20181025085447/this-week-in-neo4j-27-october-2018.jpg[name="Devansh Trivedi"]

I came Devansh as a result of his prolific blogging about his experience using Neo4j as part of the https://medium.com/@D3V4N5H/ml-day-1-bc1003447721[100 Days of Machine Learning challenge^]. 

Devansh started by https://medium.com/@D3V4N5H[creating a Word-Pair Frequency Graph^] based on song lyrics, before writing Cypher queries to find word pairs and mining paradigmatic word associations using https://medium.com/@D3V4N5H/ml-day-5-579899732cf8[Jaccard similarity^].

In his next few posts Devansh summarizes songs using the https://medium.com/@D3V4N5H/ml-day-6-9cc1a05bf6aa[TextRank algorithm^] and starts building a https://medium.com/@D3V4N5H/ml-day-14-20-week-3-e8880bec9aa8[content based recommendation engine^]. 

The challenge still has 70 days to go, so I like forward to seeing what else Devansh comes up with.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Devansh!

=== Extracting features from a peer to peer network using DeepGL

</div>
++++

https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^] has written a blog post showing how to use the DeepGL graph embedding algorithm to extract features from a Peer to Peer network.

Tomaz then projects a cosine similarity graph based on those features and runs the Louvain algorithm to find communities of similar hosts.

In the latest post of https://twitter.com/rotnroll666?lang=en[Michael Simons^]' series "From relational databases to databases with relations." he explores different ways to import data into Neo4j.

Michael shows how to use the Neo4j ETL tool, and creates a custom import DSL, but settles on using APOC's LOAD JDBC procedure because of the flexibility it provides.

Morgan observes that graphs can be used to build ontologies (shared structural conceptualizations of real world phenomena) and perform deduction (if the engine was removed, so was the piston because it is a subpart).

=== Agent Smith: A "top" application for Neo4j

<div style="float:right; padding: 2px	">

A couple of Fridays ago https://twitter.com/technige?lang=en-gb[Nigel Small^] released _Agent Smith 2.0_, a "top" application for Neo4j. The application now watches transactions, rather than queries, which gives a more stable display of "things that are running".

Up to 8 servers can now be displayed and Nigel's also implemented a kill function, using `dbms.killQuery`.

You can install Agent Smith by running the command: `pip install agentsmith`

Rik has written a blog post showing how to import and analyse a dataset containing Power Plants and their emissions into Neo4j. 

After showing how to importing the data using the Neo4j browser's multi-statement editor, Rik writes queries to find the biggest polluters, as well as most and least efficient plants.

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
