////

Welcome to This Week in Neo4j where I share the most interesting things I found in our community over the last seven days.

This week Will and I previewed the Applied Graph Algorithms training, Joe Depeau launched the Crime Investigation Sandbox, Michael launched a GraphQL to Cypher transpiler for the JVM, and more!

=== Featured Community Member: Joe Depeau

This weeks featured community member is https://twitter.com/joedepeau[Joe Depeau^], Senior Presales Consultant at Neo4j.


featured::https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20181214014206/this-week-in-neo4j-15-december-2018.jpg[name="Joe Depeau"]

Joe has been part of the Neo4j community for just under 18 months, and has quickly become one of our most popular webinar presenters. 

He's presented on a wide range of topics, including https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvLy8sxe3K4[building a recommender system^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSGRTee81RY[modelling complex financial instruments^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6uP-WxvU7k[modeling financial risk^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po2JtANQGDs[GDPR^], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR4z0mWbM-Y[fraud detection^], and of course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK-QCYAFmx0[POLE investigations^]. A common theme across these presentations is that they have excellent demos, often showing off Neo4j Bloom - a visualisation tool that we released earlier this year.

This week Joe launched the https://medium.com/neo4j/announcing-the-neo4j-crime-investigation-sandbox-c0c3bd9e71b1[Neo4j Crime Investigation Sandbox^], which has a built in tutorial showing how to do POLE investigations on a public dataset from Manchester, UK. You can launch the new sandbox from https://neo4j.com/sandbox[neo4j.com/sandbox^]. 

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Joe!

=== Online Meetup: Exploring Yelp with Graph Algorithms

In last week's online meetup, https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] and I gave a sneak peak of the Applied Graph Algorithms course that we'll be launching soon. 

youtube::7f2Tdn94JhY[type={type}]

We're still putting the finishing touches to the course, but keep an eye on the https://community.neo4j.com/t/online-meetup-exploring-yelp-with-graph-algorithms-dec-13th/3456/3[Neo4j community forum page^] as we'll announce the launch there.

=== TagOverflow: Correlating tags in StackOverflow

</div>
++++

Michael Hunger wrote a blog post showing how to use the Neo4j Graph Algorithms to correlate and categorize the tags of StackOverflow based on the questions they are attached to.

Michael starts by building a tag similarity graph using the Jaccard similarity algorithm, and then clustering and centrality algorithms over the resulting graph to gain further insights into the data.He concludes by using Graphistry and NeoVis.js to visualise the output of the algorithms.

=== Create a Data Marvel: Hydrating the Model

In the third post in https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] series of posts showing how to build a full stack application with Spring and Neo4j,  Jennifer shows how to use the APOC library hydrate the model by pulling in more data related to comics, series, and events.

The data returned by the Marvel API isn't completely consistent and therefore acts as a perfect example of the types of problems that we'll experience when working with real life datasets.

Pedro Mendonça wrote a blog post showing how to build follow system for a social network in Neo4j. 

Pedro explains how to build a graph model for such a system, creates some sample data, and then shows how to write queries to find a user and their posts, as well as finding recommended posts.

Michael released  the first milestone (1.0.0-M01) of neo4j-graphql-java - a GraphQL to Cypher transpiler for the JVM.

If you want to use GraphQL with Neo4j from any JVM based web application or API, this library will give you the same freedom as you're used to with the neo4j-graphql-js library.

A couple of weeks ago Rik interviewed Will Lyon, my colleague in the Developer Relations team at Neo4j.

Will describes his introduction to Neo4j at a hackathon that he won by building a collaborative filtering based GitHub project recommendation engine, before going into detail about his work on the https://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^]. He also talks about his experience working on the https://neo4j.com/blog/story-behind-russian-twitter-trolls/[Russian Twitter Trolls^] dataset earlier this year.

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.

Lauren explains her design decisions and looks at the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Lauren and https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] also have https://twitter.com/ML_auren/status/1017522612316983296[an interesting discussion on twitter^] about using Neo4j as a master data solution for machine learning systems.
