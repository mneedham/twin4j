Yisroel has been using GraphQL with Neo4j and this week https://medium.com/@yisroelyakovson/meet-the-full-graph-stack-d32150308a87[published^] https://medium.com/@yisroelyakovson/building-a-single-graph-stack-f95590ade5af[a series^] https://medium.com/@yisroelyakovson/making-your-single-graph-stack-production-quality-ec231a938551[of articles^] about "The Full Graph Stack" where he describes using https://grandstack.io/[*GRANDstack*^] to build his web app. 

As part of his app he’s using the https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-js[neo4j-graphql-js^] library to build a GraphQL API on top of Neo4j and been providing great feedback to help speed development.

On behalf of the Neo4j and GraphQL communities, thanks for all your work Yisroel!

This week we launched our brand new https://community.neo4j.com[Neo4j Community Site & Forum^], which will act as a replacement for technical discussions that were previously taking place on Neo4j Users Slack. 

You can ask *and* answer questions around the Neo4j Graph Platform, Cypher, Drivers, Integrations and more, as well as share your projects and blog posts.

If you have any questions please ask in the https://community.neo4j.com/c/feedback-requests/community-site[Feedback category^] or email us at devrel@neo4j.com

We look forward to seeing you over there!

=== Dating Site: High Five, Low Five

This week https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^] added two new posts to his https://maxdemarzi.com/tag/dating/[Build a Dating site^] series. 

In https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/08/20/building-a-dating-site-with-neo4j-part-eight/[Part 8^] Max adds functionality to allow users to High Five and Low Five posts. He also makes it possible to block users that abuse the feature.

In https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/08/21/building-a-dating-site-with-neo4j-part-nine/[Part 9^] we implement the read side of the feature. Users can now see the high fives they've been given, and won't see any interactions with users that they've blocked.

https://twitter.com/rvanbruggen[Rik Van Bruggen^] wrote a blog post in which he shows how to analyse data from https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal[ESCO^], the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations, into Neo4j.

Rik starts by showing how to import the data using https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv/[Cypher's LOAD CSV^] command, before executing shortest path queries between two job titles based on the skills required to do those jobs. 

He concludes the post with a quick look at what we could do with this dataset using https://neo4j.com/bloom/[Neo4j Bloom^].

=== How Graphs Revolutionize Identity and Access Management

https://twitter.com/ellazal[Lju Lazaravic^] presented a webinar in which she explained why Neo4j is such a great fit for Identity and Access Management.

youtube::Mk1QYLOeq3s[type={type}]

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.

Lauren explains her design decisions and looks at the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Lauren and https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] also have https://twitter.com/ML_auren/status/1017522612316983296[an interesting discussion on twitter^] about using Neo4j as a master data solution for machine learning systems.
