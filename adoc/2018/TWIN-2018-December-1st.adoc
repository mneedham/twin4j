[Body copy:]
////

Welcome to This Week in Neo4j where I share the most interesting things I found in our community over the last seven days.

This week I had fun with the online meetup on similarity algorithms with Tomaz Bratanic. I came across a great post written by Adrien Sales showing how to analyse PostgreSQL metadata using Neo4j and learned a neat approach to ingesting data into Neo4j using Kafka Streams and GraphQL.

https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] travelled to Krakow this week and presented https://www.slideshare.net/jexp/how-graph-databases-efficiently-store-manage-and-query-connected-data-at-scale[How Graph Databases efficiently store, manage and query connected data at scale^] at the http://coredump.events/2018/[CoreDump^] conference. Don't forget to say hi if you see us at any events you're attending.

Tom has been part of the Neo4j community for several years, and will be particularly well known to those of you in Belgium, where he has presented at meetups and given training sessions. 

Tom  has also been a contributor to the popular APOC library.  

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Tom!

=== Online Meetup: Iterative modeling of corporate resources in a rapidly growing company

In last week's online meetup, Ward Cunningham showed off https://github.com/newrelic/el-dorado-ui[El Dorado^]  - a tool he's built to collect metadata from all aspects of NewRelic's operations to build a graph based structure warehouse.


youtube::E0N138ThyMI[type={type}]

Ward has also setup a version of the tool http://home.c2.com:9292/schema_with_sources[running on a dummy dataset^] if you want to see how it works in more detail.  

[[features-2]]
=== New Neo4j Integration with Kafka 

++++
<div style="float:right; padding: 2px	">

</div>
++++

One of the most common requests that we've received in recent years is an integration with Apache Kafka, and this week we released the first version of this integration.

The Kafka Producer communicates data from Neo4j's event listener to a Kafka topic, and on the Consumer side you can specify a piece of Cypher that will execute every time a message is received on a Kafka topic. 

If you're interested in influencing our work in this area don't forget to fill in https://goo.gl/forms/VLwvqwsIvdfdm9fL2[our quick survey^]

</div>
++++

Jennifer Reif has started a series of blog posts in which she'll show how to build a full stack application with Spring and Neo4j based on the Marvel dataset.

In the first post Jennifer evaluates Marvel's API, and then comes up with an initial graph data model after several whiteboard sessions.

=== kNN: Classification of members of congress using similarity algorithms

<div style="float:right; padding: 2px	">

</div>
++++

Tomaz Bratanic has written a blog post showing how to use Neo4j's similarity algorithms as part of a k-Nearest Neighbours classification algorithm to work out how members of congress are likely to vote.

Tomaz explains how to use the similarity algorithms to find each node's top k neighbours, and then select the majority class from those neighbours as the predicted class.

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
