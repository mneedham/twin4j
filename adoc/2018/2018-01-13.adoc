Chris worked for Neo4j from 2012 - 2016 and spent a lot of time working with Neo4j customers, gaining knowledge which he shared in his https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGY8FVQc9E4[GraphConnect San Francisco 2015 talk^] and https://neo4j.com/blog/8-tips-succeeding-with-neo4j/[accompanying blog post^]. 


Chris has also presented at many meetups and led Neo4j training courses in the US, across Europe, and in Australia.


More recently Chris created and maintains the https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client/releases/tag/v2.2.0[Neo4j C client^] and 
https://github.com/cleishm/libcypher-parser[libcypher-parser^], a parser library and linter for the Cypher query language.


On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Chris!

=== FOSDEM Graph Processing Room Schedule


The schedule for the https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/graph_processing/[Graph Processing room^] at https://fosdem.org/2018/[FOSDEM^] has been finalised and it looks like it's going to be a fun day.

FOSDEM is run over the weekend of the 3rd and 4th February 2018 at the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. The Graph Processing Room is on the Saturday. I attended in 2015 and it was great fun seeing all the different things people were doing with graphs. I'd recommend going along if you can.


=== Neo4j on Azure template updated


We've released a new version of the Azure template to support the latest version of Neo4j Enterprise.

This update also address problems users have experienced with the template due to a change in the portal UI. You can find the updated template in the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/neo4j.neo4j-enterprise-edition?tab=Overview[Azure marketplace^]
