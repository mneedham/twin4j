[Body copy:]
////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we work out the best tennis player in the world using weighted PageRank, we learn how to do backups on Kubernetes, and how to model financial risks. We also have a great story about using Neo4j to store the storylines of an interactive Theatre Production, and there's the launch of the Graph Gallery Graph App.

Dimitry has been working with our partner Neueda.
Over the last year he was one of the main contributors to the https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin[Cypher for Gremlin] transpiler.

Dimitry is an active member of the openCypher implementers group and has frequently presented on the progress of the project at the groups's meetings and other events.

He also co-presented on the topic at GraphConnect 2017 in NYC in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrWnUFXjeMQ["Cypher Everywhere: Neo4j, Hadoop/Spark and the Unexpected"]

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Dimitry!

=== Weighted PageRank with Neo4j Graph Algorithms

This week we released version 3.4.8.0 of the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library, which now has support for weighted PageRank. https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^] and I have written blog posts showing how to use it. 

Tomaz https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2018/10/06/running-weighted-pagerank-on-a-telecommunications-network-in-neo4j/[beat me to it^], showing the difference in using non weighted and weighted PageRank to find the most influential IP addresses on an AT&T Network telecommunications dataset from Kaggle. 

I then https://medium.com/neo4j/finding-the-best-tennis-players-of-all-time-using-weighted-pagerank-6950ed5fc98e[wrote a blog post^] where I attempted to reproduce Filippo Radicchi’s paper in which he works out who was the best tennis player ever. Spoiler alert: It’s Roger Federer!

=== How to Model Financial Risk with a Graph Database

https://community.neo4j.com/t/joe-depeau-london-based-sales-engineer/158[Joe Depeau^] presented a webinar this week in which he showed how to model financial risk in a graph database, with a particular focus on https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/Secondary-Markets/secondary-markets-regulation/fundamental-review-of-the-trading-book-frtb/[FRTB^] compliance.

=== How to Painlessly Unite Art with Java, JavaScript, and Graphs

Alex Tavgen published an article explaining one of the coolest uses of Neo4j that I've come across. 

Alex and his team produced a theatre production where the story evolves based on audience participation. After each scene the audience votes and the next scene is based on the outcome of the vote. If they vote for a utopia, it will descend into dystopia. 

Behind the scenes they use Neo4j to store a graph of all the scenarios built by the scriptwriters. It's all wired together to a web application that uses Spring Boot, which has support for Neo4j out of the box.

Graph Apps are single-page applications that takes advantage of some services provided by Neo4j Desktop around the the management of Neo4j Databases.

This week Michael Hunger launched a new Graph App - “Graph Gallery”. It allows you to browse and search Graph Examples (also known as Graph Gists) provided by the Neo4j Community across a variety of use cases and industries. 

With a single click, you can launch any of those examples as a Browser Guide in the Neo4j Browser of your currently running database.

This week Rik interviewed https://twitter.com/rotnroll666[Michael Simons^], a Software Engineer on our Spring Data Neo4j and Neo4j OGM team. 

Michael gives an overview of Spring Boot and how Neo4j OGM and Spring Data Neo4j play in that ecosystem, and explains his entry into the world of graphs via https://jqassistant.org/[jQAssistant^], the popular software analytics tool. 

Michael also shares his views on the future of the software industry and his plans to build a new talk around the intersection of SQL and Cypher analytical queries. I look forward to seeing that talk when it's ready!

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
