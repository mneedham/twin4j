=== Graph-Based Customer Journey Analytics with Neo4j

On Thursday https://twitter.com/BarrasaDV[Jesús Barrasa^] presented a webinar, in which he showed how Neo4j can be used for Customer Journey Analytics.

youtube::Rlh9PkHinAs[type={type}]

Jesus shows how we can explore our customer data and execute high level churn analysis as well as testing basic hypotheses using a combination of the Cypher query language and https://neo4j.com/bloom/[Neo4j Bloom^] visualization tool. 

If you want to see a more extensive worked example of this technique, Adam Cowley wrote a post a few months ago showing how to https://www.adamcowley.co.uk/neo4j/importing-google-analytics-to-neo4j-via-bigquery-using-apoc-jdbc/[analyse Google Analytics data with Neo4j^].


[[features-2]]
=== Decision Trees in Neo4j

++++
<div style="float:right; padding: 2px	">

</div>
++++

https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^] shared the slides from his GraphConnect talk - Decision Trees in Neo4j, Building dynamic expert systems and rules engines.

In the talk Max shows how to build a dynamic rules engine that's able to determine whether a person should be allowed to enter a bar or not.

Max achieves this using https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/tutorial-traversal/[Neo4j's Traversal framework^] - an API that gives you very fine grained control over graph traversals. It's all then neatly packaged in a user defined procedure.

You can read more about Max's approach in a couple of blog posts he wrote in early 2018:

* https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/01/14/dynamic-rule-based-decision-trees-in-neo4j/[Dynamic Rule Based Decision Trees in Neo4j^]

* https://twitter.com/Loguteva[Kate Loguteva^] has written a blog post showing how to http://optimalbi.com/blog/2018/09/25/data-vault-on-graph-database/[implement Data Vault (a methodology for building data warehouses) in Neo4j^].

* https://twitter.com/rotnroll666[Michael Simons^] has written a blog post titled https://medium.com/neo4j/spring-data-lovelace-neo4j-ogm-3-1-3-went-ga-36614b60c889[Spring Data Lovelace & Neo4j-OGM 3.1.3 went GA^]. In the post Michael goes through the new features in Neo4j-OGM, including an improved loading mechanism, better handling of class hierarchies, and nested property filter support. He also describes new features in Spring Data Neo4j 5.1 Lovelace, such as the introduction of Persistence constructors and auditing support. 

* https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] https://codesandbox.io/s/m56625lz8x[created a GraphQL server with Apollo^] using the brand new https://hackernoon.com/codesandbox-containers-5864a8f26715[CodeSandbox Containers^]. Will's example server uses https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js[neo4j-graphql-js^] to generate database queries from GraphQL type definitions.

=== DeepGL on Neo4j - Deep Feature Learning for Graphs

++++
<div style="float:right; padding: 2px	">

We've heard a lot of interest in running graph embedding algorithms on Neo4j and over the last few months https://uk.linkedin.com/in/pete-meltzer-400607148[Pete Meltzer^] and I have written a user defined procedure that implements the https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08829[DeepGL^] algorithm. 

One of the things we liked about this algorithm is that it's designed to keep memory usage low and also returns the names of the features that it comes up with, which is helpful for model understanding. 

We're using the https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/nd4j-overview[nd4j^] library to do matrix calculations and Pete spent a lot of time working out how to fine tune our use of that library so big thanks to him for that!

You can download the code for the algorithm from our experimental https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/ml-models/releases/tag/1.0.2[ml-models^] GitHub repository.

We'd love to hear if the algorithm is useful as part of your machine learning workflow, so let us know how you get on by sending an email to devrel@neo4j.com or p.meltzer@braintree.com.

=== Teammates of Champions, Causal Cluster on AWS, Graphs for Software Analytics

* I came across a fascinating blog post written by https://twitter.com/atseajournal[Erik Germani^] looking at the https://atseajournal.com/nba/shaq-bacon/[teammates of NBA champions^]. Erik observes that since 1983, every NBA champion has featured a player who was on the same team as Shaquille O'Neal at some point in their career. He then uses Neo4j to find other players who have similarly long streaks of being teammates with the champions. 

* Neo4j 3.4.7 enterprise causal cluster update is https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07D441G55[live on AWS Marketplace^]. WIth just a few clicks and under five minutes you can get a graph cluster up and running.

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
