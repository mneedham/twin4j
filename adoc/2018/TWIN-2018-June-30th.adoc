This Week in Neo4j – abc

[Body copy:]
////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we have a procedures library for running linear regression on Neo4j, the Yen's k-shortest path algorithm, using GraphQL for database administration, exploring the World Cup with Neo4j Bloom, and more!

In https://medium.com/neo4j/graphs-and-linear-regression-734d1446e9cd[Graphs and ML: Linear Regression?^] my colleague Lauren Shin describes a set of user-defined procedures that she implemented to create a linear regression model in Neo4j. 

Lauren goes on to demonstrate the  use of linear regression from the Neo4j browser to suggest prices for short term rentals in Austin, Texas. 

You can https://github.com/neo4j-graph-analytics/ml-models/releases/tag/1.0.0[download the ml-models library^] containing these procedures from the GitHub releases page.

=== Analysing the World Cup with Cypher, GraphQL, and Neo4j Bloom

In this week's online meetup Jesus Barrasa and I showed how to query the World Cup 2018 Graph with 3 different tools: Cypher, GraphQL, and Neo4j Bloom.

It was quite a fun experience trying to work out which tool worked best for which type of queries. 
If you want to learn more about the World Cup Graph you can https://medium.com/neo4j/world-cup-2018-graph-19fbac0a75db[read the blog post^], all the code is in the https://github.com/mneedham/neo4j-worldcup/[neo4j-world-cup^] repository, and the https://www.slideshare.net/neo4j/the-world-cup-graph-2018[slides from the talk^] are also available. 

[[yens]]
=== Graph Algorithms: Yen's k-shortest path

In Tomaz Bratanic's latest post he shows how to https://tbgraph.wordpress.com/2018/06/28/finding-alternative-routes-in-california-road-network-with-neo4j/[find alternative routes in the California road network using Neo4j Graph Algorithms^]. 

He starts by showing how to find the shortest path between two places using Dijkstra algorithm's and then goes on to demonstrate Yen’s k-shortest paths algorithm which allows us to get the 2nd shortest path, 3rd shortest path, and so on. 

This algorithm is very handy in the transport domain where we might want to find alternative routes if there's a problem with the shortest one.

* Emad Panah explains how it took only 20 minutes to  https://medium.com/@emad.panah/create-neo4j-procedure-with-kotlin-in-20-minutes-75fa374c46e4[create a Neo4j Procedure that converts a string to SHA256 Hash^] using the Kotlin programming language.

* Michael wrote a post explaining how to https://medium.com/@mesirii/using-a-graphql-api-for-database-administration-1a5039b43c8f[use a GraphQL API for database administration^]. In the post he explains how to expose all available procedures either as GraphQL queries or mutations. 


* Sinister China Penguin wanted to connect SQL Server and Neo4j and https://medium.com/neo4j/building-a-graph-with-neo4j-http-api-powershell-464c75568312[explains how to do this^] using a combination of the Neo4j HTTP API & PowerShell.

=== Preserving the Neo4j pagecache across database restarts

While browsing the https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/[Neo4j Knowledge base^] I came across an entry explaining a 3.4 feature that I didn't even know about!

3.4 has a new active page cache warmup feature in the Enterprise Edition. The memory contents of the Neo4j page cache are periodically profiled, and these profiles are used to quickly reheat the cache on startup. This decreases the time-to-performance for restarts or crashes.

Our customer success team have https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/preserving-the-neo4j-pagecache-across-database-restarts/[written a knowledge base article^] explaining this feature in more detail.
