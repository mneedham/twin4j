[Body copy:]
////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we have a new release of the Graph Algorithms library and an eBook explaining how to use it. Global Witness published their final report on graphing the UK company ownership register with Neo4j, Emil is interviewed about using Neo4j to store POLE data, and more!

David has been doing a lot of research around graph based machine learning and has published blog posts explaining how to https://medium.com/octavian-ai/an-introduction-to-machine-learning-on-graph-databases-24ee502fd12e[use Keras with Neo4j^], as well as how to make https://medium.com/octavian-ai/review-prediction-with-neo4j-and-tensorflow-1cd33996632a[review predictions using Neo4j and Tensorflow^]. 

Most recently David has been writing about https://medium.com/octavian-ai/neural-graph-memory-82ccc6db3c02[Neural Graph Memory^], a new architecture for connecting neural networks to knowledge graphs, and has shown how to https://medium.com/octavian-ai/answering-english-questions-using-knowledge-graphs-and-sequence-translation-2acbaa35a21d[use sequence translation to convert English questions to Cypher queries^].

David also writes more generally about machine learning, including https://medium.com/octavian-ai/things-to-learn-for-developing-and-researching-ml-374b58947f4c[things to learn for developing and researching ML^] and https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-pick-the-best-learning-rate-for-your-machine-learning-project-9c28865039a8[how to pick the best learning rate for your machine learning project^]. 

On behalf of the Neo4j and machine learning communities, thanks for all your work David!

This week we released a new version of the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/[Neo4j Graph Algorithms library^], which now has support for the Random Walk and Personalized PageRank algorithms.

The Random Walk algorithm was contributed by Freya Behrens, Sebastian Bischoff, Pius Ladenburger, Julius Rückin, Laurenz Seidel, Fabian Stolp, Michael Vaichenker and Adrian Ziegler of the https://meta-exp.github.io/[MetaExp-Project^],  so a big thanks to them for their work.

We've also fixed bugs with the Closeness Centrality and Delta Stepping algorithms, and the Yen's shortest path algorithm now stores a relationship property containing the costs of relationships on the shortest paths it's calculated.

On my GitHub travels I came across a few interesting projects that you can take a look at if you get some time over the weekend.

* https://github.com/fdezdaniel/WikiLink[WikiLink^] is a web project that allows faster searching & graph visualization on the link network created between the Wikipedia Categories & Pages URLs.

* https://github.com/srp324/Hospital-Organ-Transplant-API[Hospital-Organ-Transplant-API^] is a Neo4j backed GraphQL API providing hospital organ transplant data.

* https://github.com/Wenzel/oswatcher[oswatcher^] is an open Neo4j database of operating systems. 

* https://github.com/vitorhorta/netscan-neo4j[netscan-neo4j^] is an overlapping community detection algorithm plugin for Neo4j. 

* https://github.com/wScottSh/family-history-app[family-history-app^] is a http://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^] backed application used for organizing and securely holding your family memories.

=== Graph Algorithms eBook, POLE and graph, Intro to Neo4j OGM

* This week we released a https://neo4j.com/whitepapers/graph-algorithms-neo4j-ebook/[Graph Algorithms eBook^] that I worked on with https://twitter.com/amyhodler?lang=en[Amy Hodler^]. The book has two parts: the first gives an overview of graph algorithms and their uses, and the second is a practical guide for using the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

* https://twitter.com/emileifrem[Emil^] was interviewed by PublicNet in an article titled http://www.publicnet.co.uk/default/2018/07/25/pole-and-graph-a-duo-set-on-interpreting-criminal-networks/[POLE and graph: A duo set on interpreting criminal networks^]. In the interview Emil explains how storing POLE (Person Object Location Entity) data in Neo4j can allow law enforcement agencies to run real-time queries to spot criminal networks and fraud rings.  Joe Depeau also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK-QCYAFmx0[presented a webinar^] on this topic earlier this year.

* I came across a paper titled https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/16/369785[Mining functional annotations across species^] which is about the use of Neo4j and the Cytoscape visualization library to analyse and compare functionality across a number of genomes. 

* Scott Sosna has https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-neo4j-ogm[written a blog post^] explaining how to use Neo4j OGM to build a family tree application.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
