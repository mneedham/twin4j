=== Featured Community Member: Brian Underwood

This week’s featured community member is https://twitter.com/cheerfulstoic[Brian Underwood^], Platform Engineer at Fishbrain. 

featured::https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20180817004308/this-week-in-neo4j-18-august-2018.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80114[name="Brian Underwood"]

He has been instrumental for the Ruby community, taking the maintainer role for the widely used neo4jrb driver in 201x. Since then he has developed a lot of new features in the driver, APIs and Cypher DSL, as well as implementing a version of the driver that uses the Bolt protocol.

Brian worked for the Developer Relations team while he was traveling the world with his family for two years. During that time Brian used every opportunity to present about Neo4j and Ruby in the countries he was visiting. He also built the https://portal.graphgist.org[GraphGist portal], created a https://www.udemy.com/building-a-ruby-on-rails-application-with-neo4j/[Ruby and Neo4j video course], and wrote many examples and articles. He blogs about a wide variety of topics at http://blog.brian-underwood.codes[blog.brian-underwood.codes^].

After that he worked for a startup using Neo4j, and a few months ago moved to Sweden where he now works as Platform Engineer at Fishbrain.

Unfortunately Brian is not working with Neo4j anymore at his current job and is asking everyone for https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/issues/1516[help to find a new maintainer for the neo4jrb driver library]. So if you're using Neo4j with Ruby and would like to help/contribute please send us an email to devrel@neo4j.com. It doesn't have to be a single person doing the work - a team can share the load.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Brian!

=== YouTube: Getting Started with Neo4j 

https://neo4j.com/staff/elaine-rosenberg/[Elaine Rosenberg^], our new Principal Curriculum Developer, has started a new YouTube series of videos showing people how to get up and running with Neo4j.

In the first video Elaine shows how to download the Neo4j Desktop application, create your first project, and gives a brief tour of the database view.

In the second video we learn how to use the Neo4j browser. Elaine covers some of the most commonly used commands, shows how to load the sample movies graph, and writes Cypher queries against the dataset.

There will be more of these videos in the coming weeks, so don't forget to subscribe to the playlist.

* I came across https://medium.com/@makona/makona-101-the-why-and-what-about-our-tech-stack-bc5943874d4b[an interesting blog post^] describing how https://medium.com/@makona[Makona^] use Neo4j to store the relations between users, accounts and the money they contain, as part of their asset tracker solution. Makona is a decentralised platform used for tracking donations to NGO's. 

* https://twitter.com/einaros[Einar Otto Stangvik^] created https://github.com/einaros/neopipe[neopipe^], a little forensic tool to pipe stuff quickly into Neo4j. Give it a try and send Einar a pull request if you have a way to improve it. 

* Following on from his https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-neo4j-ogm[Introduction to Neo4j OGM^] blog post, Scott Sansa's https://dzone.com/articles/intro-to-querying-neo4j-using-ogm[latest blog post^] shows us how to query data using the same tool. He explains how to do this using in built filters as well as with Cypher queries when we want to do something custom. 

* https://twitter.com/dilyan_damyanov[Dilyan Damyanov^] continued his series of posts about modelling event data as a graph. In his latest post he goes through different things to keep in mind when https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2018/08/13/modelling-page-view-events-as-a-graph/[modeling page view events as a graph^].

https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger^] has written up his experience loading graph data into Object Graph Mappers, such as Spring Data Neo4j and Neo4j-OGM. He used the same lessons while building the neo4j-graphql integration.

In the post Michael explains the different ways we can map graph data - from variable length path queries to pattern comprehensions and map projections - and shows how to use these different approaches for data loading.

=== How Graphs Revolutionize Identity and Access Management

https://twitter.com/ellazal[Lju Lazaravic^] presented a webinar in which she explained why Neo4j is such a great fit for Identity and Access Management.

youtube::Mk1QYLOeq3s[type={type}]

Lju takes us through a worked example of a person working in a organisation with a complex hierarchy, and shows how we can use a graph to determine what resources the person should have access to. Lju finishes the talk by going through some case studies of Neo4j customers who are using graphs to solve these types of problems.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.
