[Body copy:]
////

Welcome to this week in Neo4j where we round up what's been happening in the world of graph databases in the last 7 days.

This week we have a tool for exploring large Knowledge Graphs, analysing YouTube videos using NLP techniques, multiple linear regression on graphs, data modelling for beginners, and tips for using Neo4j SDN and OGM.

=== Featured Community Member: Michael McKenzie

This week’s featured community member is https://twitter.com/mckenzma[Michael McKenzie^], Project Engineer at Encompass, Inc.

featured::https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20180803052729/this-week-in-neo4j-4-august-20183.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80114[name="Michael McKenzie"]

Michael is a relatively new, but extremely enthusiastic, member of the Neo4j community, and after powering through all the online content, he realised that he wanted to find some other people to talk graphs with in real life.

With some encouragement from our equally enthusiastic colleague https://twitter.com/askkerush[Karin^], Michael agreed to take over the https://www.meetup.com/GraphDB-DC/[Neo4j D.C.-area meetup group^] and ran https://www.meetup.com/GraphDB-DC/events/250338543/[his first event^] a couple of weeks ago. He wrote https://neo4j.com/blog/taking-the-first-step-how-to-lead-a-local-neo4j-graphdb-meetup/[an experience report^] about it on the Neo4j blog this week.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, welcome Michael, and good luck with your future meetup events!

If you'd like to follow in Michael's footsteps and get more involved with the community, we've recently launched the Neo4j Community Maven program.

=== Online Meetup: Exploring large Knowledge Graphs with MetaExp

This week on the online meetup Sebastian Bischoff and Fabian Stolp presented https://meta-exp.github.io/[MetaExp^], a system they built that assists the user during the exploration of large knowledge graphs, given two sets of initial nodes.

youtube::6aBsPquK-kg[type={type}]

You can find the https://meta-exp.github.io/resources/presentation.pdf[slides^] from the talk and a https://meta-exp.github.io/resources/paper.pdf[paper^] describing their work in more detail. As part of the project they also wrote the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/random-walk/[Random Walk algorithm^], which was recently added to the Graph Algorithms library.

This week we have some good resources for beginners to get started with Neo4j and graph databases. 

My colleague Bryce has https://neo4j.com/blog/data-modeling-pitfalls/[written a blog post^] in which he takes us through the modeling decisions you might have to make if you were designing a graph for an email fraud detection application and explains common pitfalls that we should try to avoid.

We also recently published a new eBook - https://neo4j.com/whitepapers/getting-started-with-cypher/[Getting Started with Cypher: A Beginner's Guide to the Graph Query Language^], which is a great place to start if you want to quickly learn how to derive insights from your graph data.

=== Creating Nodes and Relationships Dynamically with APOC 

Creating nodes and relationships with Cypher is really straightforward. It only gets tricky when you have labels, relationship-types or property-keys that are driven by data and dynamic.

youtube::KsAb8QHClNg[type={type}]

The Cypher planner only works with static tokens and in this video https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael^] shows how APOC procedures come to the rescue here for creating, merging and updating nodes and relationships with dynamic data coming from user provided strings or lists.

Lauren explains her design decisions and looks at the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. Lauren and https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] also have https://twitter.com/ML_auren/status/1017522612316983296[an interesting discussion on twitter^] about using Neo4j as a master data solution for machine learning systems.
