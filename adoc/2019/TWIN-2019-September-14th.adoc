=== Featured Community Member: Betsy Hilliard

Our featured community member this week is Betsy Hilliard, Senior Scientist at Valkyrie Intelligence.

Betsy is a classic graph-nerd who is fortunate enough to work at a company with a slew of other graph-nerds (that’s what happens when the CEO is a graph-nerd).

We first connected to Betsy when she read about Global Graph Celebration Day on ‘This Week in Neo4j’ and signed her company up to host an event in their office in Austin, Texas. 

She even https://twitter.com/ValkyrieIntel/status/1117963860412125184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1117963860412125184&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fneo4j.com%2Fblog%2Fheres-how-the-neo4j-community-celebrated-global-graph-celebration-day%2F[baked a seven bridges cake!] 

From there, she signed up for the https://neo4j.com/speaker-program/[Neo4j Speaker Program^], and we’ve continued conversations on what other opportunities we can get her more involved with the community. 

(PS. we love community suggestions, if you have any ideas for what you’d like to see, let us know community@neo4j.com).

Betsy is a trailblazer who is passionate about graphs and helping others advance their knowledge. We’re so lucky and thankful to have someone like Betsy (and her team at Valkyrie) in our community.
