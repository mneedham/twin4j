We respect and admire when our community members take the initiative to lead, grow, and help our strengthen the Neo4j community. Gérald Billoir is an example of one of those people.   

Gérald is a product developer and has built products from the ground-up, focusing much of his work around eCommerce tools for small business owners.  His most recent project is to build out https://www.graphmapper.com[GraphMapper^], applying network science to understand business markets. 

As you’d imagine, Gérald is passionate about graphs, and reached out to us with a desire to help build upon the meetup community in Budapest. He connected with Janos Szendi-Varga, who was one of the lead co-organizers of the meetup who had since moved to UAE, and was able to join the organizing team with Zoltán Vigh, Gábor Döbrei, and Szárnyas Gábor. Gérald worked hard and scheduled his https://www.meetup.com/neo4j-budapest-users/events/261645651/[first event for June 25, 2019^].

Bea showed us how to model Premier League and La Liga data, and then analyses the data to work out whether home advantage actually helps. You can find the code and slides from the talk in the https://github.com/chucheria/2019_SatRdaysParis[2019_SatRdaysParis^] GitHub repository.

Volodymyr Miz shows how to combine Cassandra and Neo4j to analyse the Wikipedia Graph Dataset. Neo4j is used to analyse page structure, while Cassandra is used to analyse page popularity over time. 

Volodymyr shows how to visualise the sub graph around the page for Game of Thrones, and then shows how the popularity of characters pages has changed over time.

https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] wrote a blog post showing how to use Google Cloud Run as a serverless backend for a GRANDstack application. 

In a detailed walk through, we learn how to:

* create a Neo4j Database from the GCP marketplace
* create a Cloud Run Service that runs a  neo4j-graphql-js program 
* configure the service to serve a GraphQL API with OAuth2 support
* query our API from Apollo Launch

https://twitter.com/ryguyrg[Ryan Boyd^] launched our first-ever Neo4j Online Developer Expo and Summit (NODES), which will be on October 9th 2019. 

We’re going to keep this event very technical, with many of the sessions delivered by Neo4j experts on graph-y topics.

There will be keynotes, regular sessions, lightning talks and the mentioned Q&A panels. We will run the event with multiple tracks, so that at any given time, there should be an interesting talk for you. 

If you'd like to speak at the event, the https://www.papercall.io/nodes2019[CFP is now open^].
