This week Greta Workman interviewed Mark Grover about Data Discovery at Lyft and we opened registration for the GraphConnect 2020 conference.

We also learn about a tool for keeping track of applications in a micro services architecture, and Max De Marzi shows how to use motifs to solve link prediction problems.

Mark impressed us with his desire to share his knowledge and experience to the world through being a committer and contributor to many open source projects in the big data space, writing a http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033196.do[Hadoop Application Architectures^] book published by O'Reilly, and more.

We hope you have a chance to watch his latest video (below) about the Amundsen which he founded. Amundsen is an https://github.com/lyft/amundsen[open source data discovery application^] that seeks to improve productivity for practitioners interacting with data.  And, of course, it's powered by graphs and Neo4j!

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for your work Mark!

We didn't have a https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online Meetup^] this week, but our colleague https://www.linkedin.com/in/gretaworkman[Greta Workman^] interviewed https://twitter.com/mark_grover?lang=en[Mark Grover^] about Data Discovery at Lyft.

Mark describes the problems that scientists had finding answers about internal data systems, explains how the https://github.com/lyft/amundsen[Amundsen Project^] was built to address those problems, and outlines parts of the project's roadmap.

* Chris Skardon has written https://xclave.co.uk/2019/07/09/neo4j-ssis/[announced^] the beta launch of a Neo4j integration with Microsoft's SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). 

* Claus Engel-Christensen wrote http://claus.engel-christensen.com/2019/07/08/building-a-simple-neo4j-driver-for-clojure/[a blog post^] about https://github.com/full-spectrum/neo4clj[neo4clj^], a Neo4j Client for Clojure. Claus explains the limitations of existing Clojure drivers and provides a step by step example showing how to use neo4jclj.

* I came across https://github.com/ArcadeAnalytics/arcadeanalytics[Arcade Analytics^], an open source graph analytics platform. It looks like it could be a fun project to play with this week.
