Howdy folks-

Included this week are several great videos to share with you, so find your headphones and pop some popcorn before settling into another edition of This Week In Neo4j!

This week we have two new data science focused online trainings that are now available, a blog series about finding fraud with Neo4j, a new release of NSMNTX (a Neo4j plugin for working with RDF data), a graph algorithms talk from OSCON, a post about using GraphQL with Neo4j, a look at exploring League of Legends in Neo4j, Cypher index hints, powering data discovery systems with Neo4j, and a look at migrating dimensional models into property graphs.

Before digging in to Twin4j this week, if you’ve used the https://grandstack.io/docs/neo4j-graphql-overview.html[Neo4j GraphQL integrations^] or https://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^] I’d appreciate if you could take a few minutes to fill out https://grandstack.io/survey[this short survey^] to help guide the future of Neo4j GraphQL.

Thanks and enjoy!

Cheers,
William Lyon and the Developer Relations team

The https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/[GraphAcademy team^] has released two new free online courses to help you take advantage of graph based data science and machine learning techniques. 

The first course, https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/data-science/[Data Science with Neo4j^] shows how to use Neo4j with Python data science tools like Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, including how to use Neo4j graph algorithms like PageRank and graph based feature extraction for machine learning models. 

The second course, https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/applied-graph-algorithms/[Applied Graph Algorithms^] is designed for the application developer who wants to take advantage of graph algorithms to enhance applications. This course starts with a simple business search web application that uses React, Neo4j, and the Yelp public dataset then shows how to use graph algorithms like PageRank, community detection, and similarity metrics to add personalization features.

=== Finding Fraud With Neo4j

Graph champ https://twitter.com/maxdemarzi[Max De Marzi^] wrote a two-part series on finding fraud with Neo4j.

In the https://maxdemarzi.com/2019/08/19/finding-fraud/[first post^] he walks us through modeling credit card transactions as a graph and how to create a linked list of the transactions. Then he shows us how to use the Cypher variable length path operator and date range filters to zero in on merchants where credit card fraud occurred and all the users impacted. He then shows how to optimize the model for scale and performance. In the https://maxdemarzi.com/2019/08/20/finding-fraud-part-two/[second post^] Max digs into finding fraud rings with Neo4j and the graph algorithms plugin for Neo4j. He uses the union find algorithm to find connected components and group suspicious actors into fraud rings.

Like all of Max’s posts these are filled with lots of Cypher examples so you can see exactly how to apply these techniques.

https://twitter.com/keithdamiani[Keith Damiani^] presented https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVkTIg2D7NY[Connecting the Dots: Graph Databases and  Laravel^] at Laracon US 2019. Keith starts off the talk with a fun graph-based introduction, compares relational databases and graph databases, then hits us with some graph theory. Then after walking through some common graph database use cases and discussing the advantages of using graphs for each he shows how to use Cypher and Neo4j Browser. Finally he introduces the various options for using Neo4j with Laravel including https://github.com/Vinelab/NeoEloquent[NeoEloquent^], the https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-php-client[GraphAware PHP client^], and a new driver that he’s working on which he used to build https://larapals.com[Larapals^] a social network with the goal of helping you meet people that are outside your current network of friends. We’re looking forward to seeing the new driver when Keith releases it!

https://twitter.com/BarrasaDV[Jesús Barrasa^] has released a https://github.com/jbarrasa/neosemantics[new version of NSMNTX^], a Neo4j plugin that enables the use of RDF (a W3C standard model for data interchange) in Neo4j. NSMNTX makes it possible to store RDF data in Neo4j, export property graph data from Neo4j as RDF, as well as model mapping and inferencing on Neo4j graphs. As part of the release Jesús has also written a very comprehensive  http://jbarrasa.github.io/neosemantics/[user manual^] for NSMNTX with lots of usage examples. You can also find examples of using NSMNTX on https://jbarrasa.com/category/graph-rdf/[Jesús’ blog^]

https://twitter.com/amyhodler[Amy Hodler^] and I gave a talk at OSCON 2019 in Portland showing how to use graph algorithms with Neo4j and this week the video recording became available on the http://r.neo4j.com/youtube[Neo4j YouTube channel^].

++++
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z6V242UPQSo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
++++

The talk covers graph algorithms, when and why you should use them, how to use them in Neo4j and in the context of a web application powered by Neo4j. Then we also introduce the https://medium.com/neo4j/introducing-neuler-the-graph-algorithms-playground-d81042cfcd56[Graph Algorithms Playground^] (also known as NEuler) a graph app for Neo4j Desktop that makes it super easy to use graph algorithms without writing any code. If you haven’t tried NEuler you can install it from the https://install.graphapp.io[Graph Apps Gallery^].

For our friends in the Pacific Northwest, see how many Portland memes you can find hidden in the presentation ;-)
