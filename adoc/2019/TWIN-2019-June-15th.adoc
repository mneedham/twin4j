////

This week Mike Morley and Sony Green show us how to model and visualize borehole data with Neo4j and GraphXR, and we have a Neo4j Graph for the Women's World Cup.

We also have a Bloom Sandbox, exploration of shell companies using graph algorithms, and a redesign of the developer mini site.

=== Featured Community Member: Sony Green

Our featured community member this week is https://twitter.com/sonygreen[Sony Green^], Co-founder and Director of Business Development at Kineviz.

We first ‘connected’ (pun-intended) with Sony in 2017, when Sony emailed our Director of Developer Relations, Ryan Boyd. At the time, https://www.kineviz.com/[Kineviz^] had built a graph visualization in virtual reality. If you haven’t had the opportunity to explore your data in an alternate universe, it’s definitely a unique experience. 

Later that year, Kineviz set up a VR station in DevZone at GraphConnect NY where you could wander the connected world of GraphConnect attendees. Fast forward a lot of emails and a lot of love, Kineviz became an official https://neo4j.com/partners/[Neo4j Partners^]. They also shifted their focus to GraphXR as their main visualization tool.  

We can’t lie, it’s pretty darn cool! Sony and the Kineviz team have always made community a priority. They get involved in almost everything we do, contribute to the growth of the community, provide content, and more. 

We are so appreciative for people like Sony. His enthusiasm for partnership and collaboration is unmatched and brings so much more substance to our whole community. Thank you, Sony, for being part of this movement with us!

https://twitter.com/ryguyrg[Ryan Boyd^] launched a sandbox for Bloom, the Neo4j graph visualization, exploration, and communication tool.

This sandbox comes with the new web based version of Bloom and a Neo4j database containing a fraud dataset. Try out codeless exploration of graph data. We think you're gonna love it!

The Women's World Cup started last weekend, so we dusted off our World Cup scraping scripts and created a Women’s World Cup Graph.

If you want to explore the data, we've created a https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/womens-world-cup/[World Cup Sandbox^] that contains the data and a built in guide with queries to find top scorers, tournament winners, and more.

I just made the #GRANDstack starter a template project with @github's new repository template feature.

Just click the "Use this template" to create a new repo, no need to fork/download to get started with GraphQL and Neo4j!

Try it out here: https://github.com/grand-stack/grand-stack-starter   https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8ZYWa-UYAAaZo6.png
