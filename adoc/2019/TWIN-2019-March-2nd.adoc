This week Bea Hernández shared the slides from her talk at SatRDays on my favourite two topics - football and graphs! The Kafka connector that we've previously featured was released in the Confluent Marketplace, and Michael Hunger showed us how to analyse StackOverflow data using the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

https://neo4j.com/graphtour/[GraphTour EU^] continues after a week's break. The next two locations are Stockholm on 5th March, and Berlin on 12th March. There are still tickets available, so don't forget to register if those two cities are local to you!

Jhonathan is an educator at Universidade Estadual de Campinas, a .NET Architect, a https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001659?fullName=Jhonathan%20%20Soares[Microsoft MVP^], and a https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/neo4j-certification/[Certified Neo4j Developer^] from São Paulo, Brazil. 

Jhonathan has been very engaged in the Neo4j community for many years. He's actively involved in the organization of regional NoSQL conferences and many local meetups in his area. Frequently, he presents on Neo4j-related topics at these events. In addition to his activity in the local tech community in Sao Paulo, his self-determination and motivation to help others learn and adopt graph databases into their stack has motivated him to volunteer to translate the https://neo4j.com/whitepapers/rdbms-developers-graph-databases-ebook/[EBook: Definitive Guide to Graph Databases^] to Portuguese.

He was also the first in our community to register his local event for http://globalgraphcelebrationday.com[Global Graph Celebration Day^] for April 15th!.  As a community, we would like to thank you for all that you do for us, Jhonathan!

Michael Hunger and Andrea Santurbano published an article on the Confluent blog announcing the release of the Kafka Connect Neo4j Sink on Confluent Hub. 

This release builds on the Kafka Sink - Neo4j extension that we've previously featured, but now makes it available via remote connections over the binary bolt protocol. This means that you can now stream your events from Apache Kafka® directly into Neo4j to create, update and enrich your graph structures.

This week on the Graphistania podcast, Rik interviewed https://twitter.com/amyhodler[Amy Hodler^], Graph Analytics and AI Program Manager at Neo4j.

Amy is the author of the upcoming O'Reilly book https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/graph-algorithms/9781492047674/[Graph Algorithms: Practical Examples in Apache Spark and Neo4j^]. The book will be released in Spring 2019, but you can view an Early Access version via O'Reilly's Safari platform. 

They talk about Amy's experience writing the book, her path into the world of graphs via books written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb and James Gleick, and Amy's predictions for the future of graphs and AI.

=== TagOverflow  -  Correlating Tags in Stackoverflow

Michael shows how to compute tag correlations using the Jaccard Similarity algorithm, and then use those correlations to run other graph algorithms, such as PageRank, Betweenness Centrality, and Label Propagation. 

Michael also published his work in https://towardsdatascience.com/tagoverflow-correlating-tags-in-stackoverflow-66e2b0e1117b[a blog post^] back in December 2018.
