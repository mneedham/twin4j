Hi graph gang,

In this week's video from the https://neo4j.com/online-summit/[NODES 2019 conference^], Christophe Willemsen gives us a crash course in Neo4j's full text search functionality.

Jimmy Crequer uses Neo4j to learn the countries of the world, Andrea Santurbano converts MongoDB collections to graphs, and Michal Trnka shares GRANDstack tips and tricks

And Rik shows us how to query the data from the Carrefour Basket Data Challenge.

Enjoy!

Mark Needham, Karin Wolok, and the Developer Relations team

=== Featured Community Member: Jimmy Crequer

Our featured community member this week is Jimmy Crequer, Application Engineer at Rakuten.

Jimmy has been one of the most prolific bloggers in the Neo4j community over the last 6 months or so. I first came across Jimmy via his blog post in which he created a graph based on data from the https://medium.com/neo4j/playing-around-league-of-legends-with-neo4j-prologue-87650ceae1c[League of Legends European Championship^]. 

He also added a follow on blog post https://medium.com/neo4j/league-of-legends-with-neo4j-champions-diversity-in-worlds-2019-16999b21c457[graphing the World Finals^], and more recently built a GRANDstack application to help learn https://medium.com/neo4j/learn-japanese-characters-using-neo4j-483585abc5b8[Japanese characters^] and a graph based CLI tool to learn European countries.

I've really enjoyed reading Jimmy's blog posts. He covers lots of different topics, providing detailed instructions if the reader wants to follow along. 

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for your work Jimmy!

Jimmy Crequer wants to remember all the countries in the world, and is using graphs to help him do it. 

In the blog post Jimmy explains how to build a country graph from Wikipedia data and then explores the data using Cypher queries. He also builds a command line application to test his knowledge on capital cities and bordering countries.

Andrea Santurbano gives us a guided tour of the https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/current/[APOC^] library's `apoc.graph.fromDocument` procedure. This procedure automates the creation of graph structures from JSON documents

In the post, Andrea shows us how to use it to import data from both JSON files and MongoDB collections.
