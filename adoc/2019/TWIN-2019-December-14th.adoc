Hi graph gang,

In this week's video from the https://neo4j.com/online-summit/[NODES 2019 conference^], Louise Söderström explains schema based security in Neo4j 4.0.

Jorge Albarrán uses Neo4j to explore the Starwars Galaxy,  Jesús Barrasa enriches a knowledge graph with Wikidata, and Eric Solender released a Go OGM.

And finally, Rik explores products that were bought together in the Carrefour Basket Data Challenge.

Enjoy!

=== Featured Community Member: Keith Damiani

Our featured community member this week is Keith Damiani, Principal Full Stack Developer at Tighten, a web development agency in Chicago.

Keith is very active in the Laravel community, recently working on the https://jigsaw.tighten.co/[Jigsaw static site generator^] for Laravel developers.

He recently presented at Laracon NYC, where he shared the love for graphs and maths during his https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVkTIg2D7NY[really impressive talk].
He also built Larapals.com, a graph based networking application.

Keith recently started working on Neo4Laravel, a library that will make it easier to build graph backed Laravel applications. Matt Stauffer and Zuzana Kunckova have used Keith's groundwork and inspiration in their https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsf4F_PpNQ[live-stream programming sessions^].

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Keith!

In the latest article in https://twitter.com/BarrasaDV[Jesús Barrasa^]'s QuickGraph series, he shows us how to enrich a knowledge graph with data from Wikidata.

Jesús uses https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/nsmntx/current/import/[neosemantics^] to import countries and their borders, and runs the path finding and centrality graph algorithms to make sense of the data. He then visualises the data in the Neo4j Browser and enriches the graph by importing continent information as well.

Rik continues his series of blog posts based on data https://github.com/ging/carrefour_basket_data_challenge[from a coding challenge for Carrefour^], a big French retailer. 

In part 3 Rik explores products that are frequently bought together, and makes the surprising observation that shoppers often seem to purchase the same phone in different colours.

@here - we've just released graph algos 3.5.13.0 (available in desktop and from the download center).
There are new algorithms (k1-coloring, modularity optimization, and node similarity/jaccard, a parallelized implementation of louvain), bug fixes (triangle count), new graph loader functionality (initial support for multiple nodes), as well as some previews of the new 1.0 surface.
