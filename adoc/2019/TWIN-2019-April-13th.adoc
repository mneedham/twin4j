The big news in the Neo4j Community this week came from the Google Cloud Next 2019 conference. Neo4j formally announced a new strategic partnership with Google Cloud that delivers Neo4j as a fully managed service deeply integrated with the Google Cloud Platform. We in the DevRel team have been internal customers of the upcoming Neo4j Cloud product, and we're looking forward to everyone else getting their hands on it. 

Elsewhere, Irfan and I added support for similarity and path finding algorithms to NEuler - The Graph Algorithms Playground, Jennifer Reif published an awesome tutorial showing how to use Neo4j on Docker, and Michael Hunger showed off virtual nodes and relationships in a new video.

Sacha has been part of the Neo4j Community for several years, and has been pioneering the use of graphs in security. He shared his work in a talk titled https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TV9TSNh7pA[Six Degrees of Infiltration: Using Graph to Understand your Infrastructure and Optimize Security Decision Making^] at BSidesSF 2018. 

Sacha recently released https://github.com/lyft/cartography[cartography^], a Python tool that consolidates infrastructure assets and the relationships between them in an intuitive graph view powered by a Neo4j database.

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Sacha!

=== Graph of Thrones - Graph Visualization 101 with GraphXR 

In this week's https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online Meetup^], in preparation for Game of Thrones Season 8, Sony Green and Weidong Yang showed us how to analyse the data using GraphXR.

Using various visualisations Sony and Wei explored different parts of this virtual world, including relationships between characters and the death graph. They also show how to run graph algorithms over the graph to find the most important characters.

On Tuesday, at Google Cloud Next ’19, Neo4j formally announced a new strategic partnership with Google Cloud that delivers Neo4j as a fully managed service deeply integrated with the Google Cloud Platform.

Now every GCP user has access to graph superpowers – without having to worry about operations and management – enabling them to focus on what they care about most: building applications in the cloud.

This week we announced the release of Neo4j Euler (NEuler) - The Graph Algorithms Playground.

This is a Graph App built by Irfan Karaca and me to help make the Neo4j Graph Algorithms Library accessible to users who don't want to learn Cypher.

We've got support for nearly all the centrality, community detection, path finding, and similarity algorithms, and will be adding support for the rest in the coming weeks. If you have the Neo4j Desktop installed and are using Windows or Mac, you can one click install with the link below:

* https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] continues her overhaul of the Neo4j Developer pages, and as part of this work has https://neo4j.com/developer/docker-run-neo4j/[published a brand new Docker walkthrough/tutorial^]. 

* Michael Hunger published a link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x34FuSLt0l8&list=PL9Hl4pk2FsvXEww23lDX_owoKoqqBQpdq&index=12&t=0s[new video on using virtual nodes and rels^] - a really powerful tool for graph visualization (summarization, collapsing transitive relationships, monopartite visualisation)

* I'm a bit late with this one, but about a month ago Dan McCreary wrote https://medium.com/@dmccreary/a-taxonomy-of-graph-use-cases-2ba34618cf78[A Taxonomy of Graph Use Cases^], in which he shares the list of properties your data needs to have to need a graph database. He also describes some common use cases for graphs.

* Roberto Previdi has written a cool post showing how to use graphs and graph algortihms to help with the https://graphaware.com/neo4j/2019/03/09/graph-assisted-typescript-refactoring.html[refactoring of a Typescript application^].
