In part 5 of the BBC Good Food series, https://twitter.com/ellazal[Lju Lazarevic^] takes us through some techniques for de-duplicating ingredients. 

Using only Cypher and the APOC library, Lju shows us how to find plurals that refer to the same thing, deal with active and passive naming, ignore stop words, deal with capitalisation issues, and more.
