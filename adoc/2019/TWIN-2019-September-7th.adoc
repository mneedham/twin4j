Hello everybody!

I'm back after a few weeks off. Thanks to Jennifer and Will for writing TWIN4j in my absence, I enjoyed reading their take on the week's graph related news. 

This week we preview the modeling talks at the NODES 2019 conference and we have network analysis of the Prisoners of Zenda book.

We learn how to build a questionnaire with Neo4j, there's a video introducing Spring Data Neo4j RX, and a new release of the Neo4j for Kettle plugin.

Enjoy!

Cheers,

Mark Needham and the Developer Relations team

With just 5 weeks to go until the first https://neo4j.com/nodes-2019/[Neo4j Online Developer Summit^], it's time to preview the finalised schedule.

One of the biggest challenges for both new and seasoned users of graphs is coming up with a good graph model. The full list of talks on this topic is available by searching for the https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session-topics/?topic=modeling[modeling tag^], but here's a preview of what's on offer. 

==== Beginner

In https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/dependency-modeling[It Depends (and why it's the most frequent answer to modelling questions)^], Luanne Misquitta, VP of Engineering at GraphAware, will show how our use case should guide the model we come up with. 

==== Intermediate

Max De Marzi, one of the best graph modelers in the business, will share his 7 years of experience helping Neo4j customers in his talk https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/graph-data-modeling-tricks[Graph Data Modeling Tips & Tricks^]. 

==== Advanced

Axel Morgner, Managing Director of Structr GmbH, will do a https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/software-application-graphs-how-structr-works[deep dive into Structr^], the graph application platform.

Tomaz Bratanic combines natural language processing, graph algorithms, and graph visualisation techniques to make sense of the Prisoner of Zenda, an adventure novel written in the 19th century.

Tomaz also shared a https://github.com/tomasonjo/blogs/blob/master/Spacy_Neo4j_Gutenberg_Book/Spacy%20NER%20with%20Neo4j%20Clustering%20on%20Gutenberg%20book.ipynb[Jupyter Notebook^] containing all the code used in the blog post.

Stefan Dreverman has started a series of blog posts showing how to use Neo4j to build a questionnaire. 

In the first post we start with a single question that has multiple choices. Stefan shows how to create a graph model, import sample data, and then query it across different dimensions.

* Gerrit Meier https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfk4782Da0E[published a video^] showing how to create a sample application using the upcoming Spring Data Neo4j RX. You can find the project in the https://github.com/neo4j/sdn-rx[neo4j/sdn-rx^] GitHub repository.

* I wrote a couple of blog posts exploring Cypher's https://markhneedham.com/blog/2019/08/22/neo4j-cypher-nested-pattern-comprehensions/[nested path comprehensions^], and contrasting them to the https://markhneedham.com/blog/2019/08/23/neo4j-cypher-path-comprehensions-optional-match/[OPTIONAL MATCH^] clause.

* The video from https://twitter.com/spirnbaum[Stephan Pirnbaum^]'s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWRc9FtRWuc[An Introduction to Neo4j^] talk at Neos Con 2019  is now available. 

* Amy Hodler and I wrote a blog post for the O'Reilly Ideas blog, titled https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-graph-algorithms-improve-machine-learning[How graph algorithms improve machine learning^].
