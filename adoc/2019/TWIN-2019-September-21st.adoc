This week we preview the Knowledge Graph talks at the NODES 2019 conference and we learn how to do sentiment analysis with Neo4j and GCP NLP. 

Stefan Dreverman continues his series on building questionnaires using Neo4j, Max De Marzi builds a property graph, and there's a paper showing how to query multi dimensional events.

Enjoy!

Cheers,

Our featured community member this week is an old friend of the Neo4j Developer Relations team, https://twitter.com/kennybastani[Kenny Bastani^].

Kenny worked on the Developer Relations team in 2013 and 2014, creating a ferocious amount of content via https://neo4j.com/blog/contributor/kenny-bastani/[blog posts^] and meetup or conference presentations. 

He presented on topics including https://vimeopro.com/neo4j/videos-2013/video/79438638[Natural Language Search^] at GraphConnect 2013 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IjIMCJbLhc[Document Classification with Neo4j^]. 

Kenny did pioneering work in the graph analytics space, integrarating with Neo4j with Spark via the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-mazerunner[Mazerunner^] project. He presented on this in the talk https://www.slideshare.net/KennyBastani/graph-analytics[Big Graph Analytics on Neo4j with Apache Spark^]. This project acted as the inspiration for the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/[Neo4j Graph Algorithms Library^] that was launched in 2017. 

After leaving Neo4j Kenny went to work at Pivotal, where he continued to contribute to the Neo4j community, via presentations like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVhRSv3xSM[Using Docker, Neo4j, and Spring Cloud^] and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKFiLeyCVzE[Polyglot Persistence for Microservices using Spring Cloud and Neo4j].

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Kenny!

There's now only three weeks to go until our first https://neo4j.com/nodes-2019/[Neo4j Online Developer Summit^], and this week we're going to preview talks tagged https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session-topics/?topic=knowledge-graph[Knowledge Graphs^].

==== All

Wolfgang Hoeck will get us started in this category, with his talk titled https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/knowledge-graph-cancer-modeling-import-explore-bloom[How to build a knowledge graph from scratch even if you are not really a full-blown developer^]. 

==== Intermediate

Jan Zak will talk about a topic that's often neglected when it comes to knowledge graphs - the UI! Jan will summarise current approaches and then https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/challenges-knowledge-graph-visualization[describe a new novel user interaction pattern^]. 

==== Advanced

You won't want to miss https://neo4j.com/online-summit/session/neosemantics-linked-data-rdf-toolkit[the talk^] by our resident RDF expert, Jesus Barrasa. Jesus will be showing off https://github.com/jbarrasa/neosemantics[Neosemantics^], a linked data toolkit that he created to enable the use of RDF in Neo4j.

Stefan Dreverman continues his series of blog posts showing how to use Neo4j to build a questionnaire.

In part 3, we learn how to create a graph model that reveals question to a user based on their answers to previous questions. The approach described in this post would enable us to create a SurveyMonkey or Kahoot style application.

As with the other posts in the series, Stefan shows how to both create and query sample quizzes using the Cypher query language.

In Max De Marzi's latest blog post he shows how to build a graph based on data from the Marin County, Florida Property Appraiser. 

Max explains his simple approach to data import, runs some basic Cypher query, and then runs the Union Find graph algorithm to find clusters of properties.
