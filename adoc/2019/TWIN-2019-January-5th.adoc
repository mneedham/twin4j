Happy New Year everybody, and welcome to our first version of TWIN4j of 2019. I'd only just got used to writing the year as 2018!

This is traditionally a quiet week, but we've still got some good stuff for you to read and listen to. I always enjoy Joe Depeau's webinars and he's produced another one showing how to use Neo4j for Anti-Money laundering. David Mack gives us a crash course in machine learning on graphs, Will Lyon replicates GitHub's GraphQL API, and Dan McCreary looks forward to 2019 in the world of graphs.

=== How to Improve Anti-Money Laundering Investigation using Neo4j

At the start of December, https://twitter.com/joedepeau[Joe Depeau^] presented a webinar showing how to use Neo4j to help with anti money laundering investigations.

Joe starts by giving an overview of money laundering and anti money regulations, before describing some of the common problems encountered. He then explains how AML with connected analysis can help solve these problems, and demos an AML investigation of a fictitious bank using Neo4j and the Bloom visualization tool.

https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] has written a blog post showing how to build your own version of GitHub's GraphQL API using neo4j-graphql.js and data exported via the  download-all-of-your-GitHub-data feature. 

In the post Will shows how to import the raw data into Neo4j, then builds GraphQL type definitions and auto generates a GraphQL schema, before writing GraphQL queries to explore the data.

Dan McCreary has written an excellent article in which he summarises the world of graphs in 2018, and looks forward to the coming year. 

The post covers Knowledge Graphs, Google DeepMind's paper on Graph ML,  Custom Graph Hardware, and more. If you want a crash course in the state of graphs at the start of 2019, this is a good place to start.
