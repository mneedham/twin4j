This week Anurag Tandon has started a series of videos on Neo4j Bloom, the graph visualisation too, and Adam Cowley shows us how to text analytics with Neo4j and Cypher.

We also learn about the technology behind the upcoming Neo4j Cloud, and there are new project pages for the recently launched Neo4j Labs.

=== Featured Community Members: Jennifer Reif

Our featured community members this week is https://twitter.com/jmhreif?lang=en[Jennifer Reif^], one of my colleagues on the Developer Relations team at Neo4j.

Jennifer started working at Neo4j in February 2018, and went straight in at the deep end, presenting a training session on graph modeling and a talk at Women Who Code London in her 2nd week. 

Since then, Jennifer has travelled all over, teaching people about graphs in Los Angeles, Montreal, Kansas City, Dallas, London again, Stockholm, Chicago, and Toronto, to name just a few. If you've attended a Neo4j training session in the US in the last year, there's a good chance Jennifer taught you!

Along with all the talks, Jennifer has also done an overhaul of the https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/[Neo4j Developer pages^], which act as the starting point for new users of Neo4j, and also wrote the popular https://medium.com/neo4j/create-a-data-marvel-develop-a-full-stack-application-with-spring-and-neo4j-part-2-12186b929cb2[Marvel blog series^].

On behalf of the Neo4j community, thanks for all your work Jennifer!

A few months ago we launched Neo4j Labs,  a one-stop shop of solution offerings that provide fertile ground for innovation, while allowing us to iterate quickly and provide high-value tooling for your development work.

Michael Hunger has created pages for each of the projects, providing an overview of the project, as well as links to related videos and articles.
