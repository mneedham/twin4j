GraphTour Europe is over after a fun final event in London. There's now a break of a month or so before the US version gets started in Washington D.C. on 7th May, quickly followed by San Francisco on 9th May. 

Don't forget to https://neo4j.com/graphtour/[register^] if either of those cities are nearby.

I spent most of my time demonstrating Neuler - The Graph Algorithms Playground -  with my colleague https://twitter.com/irfannuri[Irfan^]. You can learn more about that from our https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZZFqAX-PH0&list=PL9Hl4pk2FsvVnz4oi0F8UXiD3nMNqsRO2&index=2[Online Meetup video^], and we'll have a blog post ready soon. 

It was a big week for the GRANDstack - we had a live coding session, a presentation at GraphTour London, and a new starter kit was created. 

I had fun graphing Brexit, Jennifer Reif and I wrote articles explaining how to load data into Neo4j, Ryan Boyd launched the expanded startup program, and more!

=== This Week in the GRANDstack: Live Coding, Seed Application, GraphTour

This was a busy week for the https://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^].

In this week's https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online Meetup^], Gavin Williams started with a blank project and live coded an application using the GRANDstack.

youtube::AsnXiGQ_Hi4[type={type}]

https://twitter.com/@erikbroder[Erik Rahm^] created https://github.com/erikrahm/grand-stack-seed[grand-stack-seed^] -  a seed application he created that has built in Auth and sample User GQL types/queries/mutations, to make it easy for front-end developers to quickly get up to speed with  Neo4j and neo4j-graphql-js.

And https://twitter.com/@wheresrhys[Rhys Evans^] shared the slides of his https://speakerdeck.com/wheresrhys/a-field-guide-to-the-financial-times[GraphQL heavy presentation^] from GraphTour London.

This week Ryan Boyd announced the expansion of the Neo4j Startup Program. 

The program has been expanded  to support much larger organizations, with up to 50 employees, and we've also made it easier to apply to the program and manage your membership.

And the icing on the cake is that members of the program can now get a license for the Neo4j Bloom graph visualization.

=== Graphing Brexit

On Wednesday night UK MPs voted no to series of potential Brexit options. and afterwards I read a lot analysis of how different individuals and parties had votes on various websites.

All the analysis seemed very tabular to me so I loaded the voting data into Neo4j and did a bit of graph analysis with Cypher, Neo4j Bloom, and the Graph Algorithms library.
