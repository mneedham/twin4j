Andy Robbins has started a series of posts showing how to visualise BloodHound data using PowerBI. BloodHound is a tool for exploring Active Directory Domain Security and PowerBI is Microsoft's business analytics service.

* In https://posts.specterops.io/visualizing-bloodhound-data-with-powerbi-part-1-ba8ea4908422[part 1^], Andy shows how we can use BloodHound data, the Cypher query language, and PowerBI to create elegant data visualizations that will help reveal and communicate security-related insights about your Active Directory domains.

* In https://posts.specterops.io/visualizing-bloodhound-data-with-powerbi-part-2-3e1c521fb7ae[part 2^]  he shows us how to use the https://github.com/cskardon/Neo4jDataConnectorForPowerBi/releases/latest[beta Neo4j connector for PowerBI^] to create charts that can be easily updated by simply hitting the “refresh” button in the PowerBI GUI.
