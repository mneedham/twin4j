It's been another busy week. 

This Neo4j community has had another busy week. We launched Neo4j Administration course, Amy Hodler and I shared our research into the world of link prediction, and David Allen showed us how to implement log shipping with Google's Stackdriver.

This week also saw the launch of Neo4j Labs - a one-stop shop of solution offerings that provide fertile ground for innovation, while allowing us to iterate quickly and provide high-value tooling for your development work.

On Tuesday 26th March 2019 it's time for GraphTour to visit London. I'll be there with my colleagues from the London office, so do come and say "hi". You can https://www.eventbrite.com/e/neo4j-graphtour-london-tickets-52536557257#tickets[register for the event here^].

=== Link Prediction with Neo4j

In this week's https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online Meetup^], https://twitter.com/amyhodler[Amy Hodler^] and I presented Link Prediction with Neo4j.

youtube::5tuWnq_18Qw[type={type}]

We started by explaining the problem in more detail, describe the approaches that can be taken, and the challenges that have to be addressed.

In the 2nd half we went through a worked example showing how to apply these approaches using Graph Algorithms and the popular scikit-learn machine learning library.

This meetup built on top of https://medium.com/neo4j/link-prediction-with-neo4j-part-1-an-introduction-713aa779fd9[a blog post^] that we published a couple of weeks ago. If you have any questions from the meetup you can https://community.neo4j.com/t/online-meetup-link-prediction-with-neo4j/5952[ask us on the community forum^].

On Thursday Michael Hunger announced the launch of Neo4j Labs - a one-stop shop of solution offerings that provide fertile ground for innovation, while allowing us to iterate quickly and provide high-value tooling for your development work.

Projects that become part of Neo4j Labs will be actively worked on and supported by at least one Neo4j engineer. Successful projects will eventually graduate into the Neo4j Graph Platform.

Jennifer shows how to manipulate the data retrieved from the API build earlier in the series, and then processes it to create a d3 visualization. 

* In https://medium.com/neo4j/showing-charts-for-neo4j-query-results-using-amcharts-and-structr-efae0b7a04f0[part 3^] of his series showing how to integrate ZenDesk with Neo4j, https://twitter.com/dmcanzano[Dana Canzano^] explains how to render Cypher results as charts within a Structr application.

* https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] has written a blog post showing how to https://medium.com/neo4j/configuring-stackdriver-logging-for-neo4j-vms-on-gcp-d175f32e2e1b[implement log shipping from a Neo4j VM on Google Cloud Platform into Google's Stackdriver monitoring system^]. 

* David spends a lot of his time working with customers helping them to simulate workloads, and has written a JavaScript module called https://github.com/moxious/graph-workload[graph-workload^] to automate some of the process. David explains https://medium.com/neo4j/generating-test-workloads-on-neo4j-97acc71298e6[how to use the tool^], and then use https://medium.com/neo4j/monitoring-neo4j-with-halin-4c11429b46ff[Halin^] to see how well the database is handling the traffic.
