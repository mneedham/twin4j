If graph visualisation is your thing, you're going to love the overhaul that https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] has done to the Graph Visualization Tools developer page.

Jennifer breaks down the available tools into three categories: 

* embeddable tools with Neo4j connections
* embeddable tools without direct Neo4j connection, and 
* standalone product tools. 

And then takes us on a guided tour of each category, exploring the available tools, and explaining where each is appropriate.

Vinodh Subramanian shows how to build a Neo4j application that both consumes and produces events for https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ^], the open source message broker.

He does this using a combination of custom procedures, and https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#triggers[triggers^] from the Neo4j APOC library.

* I https://medium.com/neo4j/whats-cooking-part-4-similarities-d4443d89556a[wrote a blog post^] showing how to use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm to compute recipe to recipe and collection to ingredient similarities in the BBC Good Food graph.

* This week https://twitter.com/photoft45[Tao Feng^] and https://twitter.com/mark_grover[Mark Grover^] discussed  a tool called https://eng.lyft.com/amundsen-lyfts-data-discovery-metadata-engine-62d27254fbb9[Amundsen^] on the https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/04/16/lyft-data-discovery-with-tao-feng-and-mark-grover/[Software Engineering Daily podcast^].  Amundsen is a tool that uses that uses Neo4j for data discovery, and in the interview they explain why they used Neo4j as the backend data source.

* In https://apiko.com/blog/neo4j-database-advantages/[Neo4j Database: Use Cases and Advantages For Your Project^], Helen Vdovychenko explains the benefits of graph databases and some of the most common use cases.

Efficient Neo4j Data Import Using Cypher-Scripts

I've decided to keep track of cool #Neo4j #Cypher snippets I come across/use that might be useful. The first one is on setting defaults for null values.
