Hi graph gang,

Neo4j's Database as a Service product had its official launch this week and it has a brand new name - Neo4j Aura. If you love developing graph applications but aren't experienced operating them in production, this is what you've been waiting for!

Apart from that, Alicia Frame teaches us about graph embeddings, Matt Casters shows how to write a Kettle plugin, and David Allen gives a graph modeling master class.

But before you read about any of those things, there's now less than one week to go for the Call for Papers for GraphConnect 2020. If you're not sure what to submit or just need a little bit of encouragement, be sure to read https://medium.com/neo4j/share-your-graph-story-with-the-world-at-graphconnect-2020-16a06b0dfe39[Will Lyon's blog post^].

Enjoy!

Cheers,

Mark Needham and the Developer Relations team

Mike’s a https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/neo4j-certification[Neo4j Certified Developer^] who has been addicted to graphs for many years. 

What’s awesome about having a person like Mike in our community? He does a little bit of everything and gets involved in a variety of ways.  To review some of the ‘hats’ Mike wears —  he organizes local events, like https://neo4j.com/blog/heres-how-the-neo4j-community-celebrated-global-graph-celebration-day[Global Graph Celebration Day]. This past week, he was a presenter at https://www.utahgeekevents.com/events/big-mountain-data-dev-2019[BIG MOUNTAIN DATA & DEV 2019] (and he managed to get a spot in the big room immediately following the keynote - woop woop!) :D  

He also is a contributor on the https://community.neo4j.com/[Community site^] and frequently answering technical questions, which we are SO grateful for!!!. He was also one of the winners of the https://neo4j.com/online-summit[NODES 2019 Hunger Games]! 

Oh, and he’s also a daddy and sent us a picture of his new baby girl earlier this year wearing a http://graphgearstore.com[Neo4j onesie].  Mike, we’re so thankful to have you in our community! Thank you so much for all of your contributions and all that you do!

We're actively implementing prototypes for several embeddings, and in this talk Alicia explains how they work, why we chose them, and what they can be used for.

In the latest blog post in David Allen's graph data modeling series, he goes deep on what relationships are, what they mean in a domain, and how to use them.

This post is a crash course in graph data modeling, covering a variety of topics, including:

* data normalization
* the connection between relationships and verbs
* the different types of semantics a relationship can take on
* reifying complicated relationships into more simple ones.

Nathan Smith continues to use Neo4j to explore the concepts in the https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/[Networks, Crowds and Markets^] book.

In his latest blog post, Nathan explores structural balance of triangles in the context of an alternative view of politics in the run up to World War I. 

And if you want a blast from the past, Dr Jim Webber covered similar ground in his entertaining https://neo4j.com/blog/the-graph-space-jim-webber-graphconnect/[closing keynote at GraphConnect SF 2015^] .
