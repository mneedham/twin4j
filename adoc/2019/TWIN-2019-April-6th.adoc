The exciting news this week is that we launched the Graph Apps Gallery - a one stop shop where you can find all your favourite Graph Apps and discover new ones.

Jennifer Reif wrapped up her series of posts on the Marvel Universe, I continued graphing the chaos of the British Parliament, and Cesar Pantoja showed us how to load Bitcoin into Neo4j in one day.

=== How to load Bitcoin into Neo4j in one day

In this week's https://www.meetup.com/Neo4j-Online-Meetup/[Neo4j Online Meetup^], Cesar Pantoja showed us how to load the entire Bitcoin blockchain into Neo4j, in just one day.

Cesar starts by explaining the graph model and the data pipeline used to get the data into Neo4j. before showing how to explore the way that money flows through the network.

Cesar also https://medium.com/tokenanalyst/how-to-load-bitcoin-into-neo4j-in-one-day-b555219ed9d2[wrote a blog post^] on this topic a couple of months ago.

The Neo4j Labs Team are delighted to announce the release of the first version of the Graph Apps Gallery. 

The Graphs App Gallery is an online Graph App that aims to make it easier for users to discover Graph Apps. You can use it directly from your web browser by navigating to https://install.graphapp.io/[install.graphapp.io^], or it can be installed in the Neo4j Desktop.. 

One of the Graph Apps featured is Kees Vegter's https://medium.com/neo4j/introducing-the-neo4j-database-analyzer-a989b85e4026[Neo4j Database Analyzer^], which was released this week. This is a tool that lets you get a quick understanding of the data structures in your Neo4j Database.

After 4 months of writing, featuring 10 blog posts, this week https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] wrote the final instalment in the Creating a Data Marvel Series.

Along the way we've learned how to create a graph model for the universe, load data from the API into Neo4j, design domain classes, build a web API, and build a front end. 

This week Jennifer discusses the future of the project, the lessons she's learned while building it, and shares the resources she's collected along the way

* As the British parliament descends further into chaos, I did some further exploration of the indicative votes, this time https://towardsdatascience.com/graphing-brexit-clustering-edition-3b966694e723[finding clusters of MPs who voted exactly the same way^]. 

* To celebrate the last stop of the European GraphTour in London last week, Rik http://blog.bruggen.com/2019/03/podcast-interview-with-janos-szendi.html[interviewed Janos Szendi-Varga^] of GraphAware about the https://graphaware.com/graphaware/2019/02/01/graph-technology-landscape.html[Graph Technology Landscape^] that he published a couple of months ago.

* Jennifer Reif published a knowledge base article explaining how to https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/pass-temporal-objects-parameters/[pass temporal objects as parameters^] from a Neo4j JavaScript Driver.

* Oskar Hane has written a blog post explaining how to https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-detect-a-users-preferred-color-scheme-in-javascript-ec8ee514f1ef[detect whether a user has system level dark mode enabled^], so that it can be respected by JavaScript applications. Once this has wider web browser support it will be coming to a Neo4j Browser near you. 

* Christine Betts https://blog.semanticscholar.org/finding-experts-in-grapal-b97ef280e585[released GrapAL^] - the Graph database of Academic Literature. It is built using Neo4j and contains a subset of the Semantic Scholar knowledge base of academic literature.

Building on the https://medium.com/neo4j/link-prediction-with-neo4j-part-1-an-introduction-713aa779fd9[introduction to link prediction^] blog post that I wrote a few weeks ago, this week I show how to use these techniques on a citation graph.

In this post we learn about splitting train and test graphs, engineering link prediction features, and how to train a random forest classifier using the popular scikit-learn library.
