This week Anurag Tandon shows us how to do Near Natural Language Search in Bloom, and we saw the release Neo4j Enterprise Causal Clustering on Pivotal Container Service (PKS). 

We also learn how to use Siren, an investigative intelligence platform, with Neo4j, and Dave Fauth has started a series of posts connecting Neo4j, MySQL, and Kafka.

Vlasta has been part of the Neo4j community for several years, and has been one of the main thought leaders in the area of graph based machine learning.

Vlasta has presented at multiple Neo4j meetups on topics like https://www.slideshare.net/graphaware/graphpowered-machine-learning-90048080?ref=https://graphaware.com/resources/[Graph Based Machine Learning^] and https://www.slideshare.net/graphaware/signals-from-outer-space-98633653?ref=https://graphaware.com/resources/[Graph-Powered NLP^]. And this week Vlasta presented a very popular talk on AI and NLP at GraphTour Chicago.

=== Near Natural Language Search in Bloom (Video #2 in Bloom Series)

In the 2nd video of https://www.linkedin.com/in/tandonanurag[Anurag Tandon^]'s series of videos on Neo4j Bloom, the graph visualisation tool, we learn about near natural language search.

With the help of a finance dataset, Anurag takes us on a guided tour of Bloom's search capabilities, including basic search terms, search phrases, and pattern based search.

David Allen announced the release of Neo4j Enterprise Causal Clustering on https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service[Pivotal Container Service^] (PKS), Pivotal's Enterprise Kubernetes platform.

This distribution makes it possible to quickly and easily spin up a clustered, highly available graph database on top of Kubernetes.

Siren is an investigative intelligence platform that recently added first level support for graph databases.

Giovanni Tummarello has written a detailed tutorial explaining how to use this new functionality to hunt down fraudsters in a financed graph stored in Neo4j.

Dave Fauth has started a series of posts showing how to stream data from MySQL into Kafka, and from there into Neo4j .

In the first post Dave sets up https://maxwells-daemon.io/[Maxwell’s Daemon^] to stream data from MySQL to Kafka, and configures a Neo4j cluster with Neo4j Kafka Streams to connect to a Kafka server.

We released a couple of new versions of the Graph Algorithms Library over the last few weeks.

These releases introduce a procedure to compute the memory requirements of running graph algorithms, more fine grained control over concurrency settings, as well as usability and bug fixes.
